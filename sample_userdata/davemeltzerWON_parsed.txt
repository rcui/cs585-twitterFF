Jericho nailed Omega with the dinner table.
And suddenly the press conference is over.  That was the NJPW equivalent to firing Monster Energy drinks back and forth.
Jericho said this would be Omega's last match ever in Japan.  Totally different Jericho character from his last five incarnations.
Omega just attacked Jericho at the dinner table.
Jericho is out to the Tokyo Dome music.  This is kind of surreal.
They just announced for the first time it's a double main event.  I can wait to see the overreaction to that announcement.

@TheHeelFace @ImNidin And to be fair, worrying about 1/4* of a match years ago is kind of mind blowing.
@TheHeelFace @ImNidin And I wasn't rating it years later.
@TheHeelFace @ImNidin At the time, only one newsletter gave it *****, everyone else ****3/4.  It took on a life of its own later.
@TheHeelFace @ImNidin Reading would be your friend.  I've given ***** ratings to WWE matches before and will again.
