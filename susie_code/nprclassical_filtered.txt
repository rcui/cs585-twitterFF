.@BigRicardo23 Dunno if I've ever heard my "ultimate" Shostakovich 13 or 15 on rec. Rostropovich is popular choice...&amp; now so is Gergiev./AT
.@NLMFestival The emersons with Pressler is certainly not new,but wonderful. Don't know of recent recs. of that piece. /th
.@BigRicardo23 For the Brahms -- I am such a fan these days of Leonidas Kavakos; try him. Late Shostakovich... hmm. 1/2 /AT
.@jorgealonzo526 "best" so subjective! Would you prefer modern or older? /AT
.@veronicazupanic Mozart Clarinet Quintet! If you can find it, the Buddy (Harold) Wright rec w/other members of the @BostonSymphony . /AT
.@BigRicardo23 Brahms? Oh boy lots to choose. Mullova, Milstein, Oistrakh and Mutter. Shosty: I've been liking the Petrenko series. /th
.@ashuttl @anastasiat I'm always surprised at how wonderful the Dvorak Quartets are. Especially Nos. 10 and 11. /TH
.@ashuttl Also Takacs -- the Beethoven quartets or, for something very different, Benjamin Britten's string quartets. /AT
.@ashuttl I'd be totally remiss, as obvious as it sounds, to not mention Takacs doing the Schubert Quintet &amp; Quartettsatz. /AT
.@ashuttl @anastasiat Are you looking for another piece of music or another rec. of the Schubert? /TH
I'll mention a couple of new projects I've been listening to this week: @violincase owner's Mozart Violin Cto 5 &amp; Vieutemps 4. /AT

.@yiqingsim My fave recent Mahler 2 is, by quite a ways, Jurowski with London Phil. /TH
.@AaronLC It's not brass alone, just BIG brass sound. Give it a try (or Taras Bulba. Or his opera House of the Dead.) /AT
.@Colin_H_Hart Ohhh, my beloved Osvaldo. (A friend.) Do you know his "Ayre"? http://t.co/OmlQUzReoN /AT

.@Abeaver91 Fortunately, so many places to go with Sibelius 2: Davis/Boston, Vanska/Lahti, and Szell/Concertgebouw, which is terrific!
.@AaronLC How about Janacek? The Sinfonietta (big brass) is a particular favorite of mine. http://t.co/uS2rjaagn5 /AT
.@nikenator Kick up Mahler? (?!?!?!?!)  All right. Mahler's 8th, "Symphony of a Thousand": http://t.co/xF5ZJJ1PXE /AT
.@misterpatches You want the full ballet of the suite? Jansons and the Concertgebouw do a nice Suite.
.@nikenator Honestly, I find Mahler completely sui generis (and I'm an enormous fan.) Some folks find Bruckner's parallel -- not me. :) /AT
.@misterpatches Hmm. What about Prokofiev's violin concertos? http://t.co/1hVayJ4LMw /AT
.@nikenator Do you want Mahler, want the burner up high or low? High = Bernstein, lower = Chailly... I think there's room for both.
.@nikenator Would it be fair of me to rec his song cycle Songs of a Wayfairer? :)  Or looking for something a little more recmoved? /AT

.@MSStateRoss @ryan And this, which remains one of my favorite radio pieces I've done (Weinberg-related): http://t.co/eSr9G92tBX /AT
.@Ryan: Sometimes the Weinbergs sound a little TOO much like Shostakovich…  But I like them. /TH
.@MSStateRoss @ryan Speaking of Weinberg: http://t.co/jwD0BGdYyo /AT
.@Seth: at least we have Bolcom’s ‘View form the Bridge’ which is a terrific opera! /TH
.@earbox Deities forbid, but it kind of seems that way, doesn't it? One (-ish)-and-done is a terrible fate. /AT
.@veronica: I’m also partial to the old Smetana Qt. recording of the Janaceks /TH
.@davidgweininger @Veronica You know which other qt's Bartok I adore?  The Takacs. So vivid &amp; visceral. /AT
.@Ryan: I thinks it’s a logical (side) step from Janacek to Shostakovich, Bartok, Schnittke, Schulhoff, even Ligeti /TH
.@MSStateRoss Aha. Going for obscure 19th/20th century Scottish, I see. Wasn't there a whole Chandos series?
.@veronica: Like similar stuff. Try the Shostakovich cycle and Alfred Schnittke!. /TH
.@veronica: For sheer theatricality in the Janacek, try the Hagen Qt. on DG from 20 years ago. Stunning and in your face. /TH
.@veronicazupanic Oh, got it. Well, for the Bartok qts, I think the superb @EmersonQuartet full set for sure. /AT

And for new music try ‘Excelsior,’ by the young, increasingly awesome Caleb Burhans @Pluckbro performed by the Fifth House Ensemble. /TH
A Milhaud "Oresteia of Aeschylus" on Naxos (with  University of Michigan musicians). Very curious about this one. /AT
Also, albums I haven't heard yet but really looking forward to opening up: Behzod Abduraimov's Tchaik 1/Prok 3 piano ctos and...  /AT
.@Chris: There’s a recent Nyman piano disc by Lisitsa and a new Turnage ‘Undance’ that sounds great on NMC label./TH
There’s a new electrifying ‘Elektra.’ Evelyn Herlitzius is a powerhouse. HUGE orchestra strong under Thielemann in  Dresden. /TH
.@YonatanADoron I'll have to look that up! /AT

BTW, I (AT) am in NYC, and Tom is in Washington DC -- this is our work setup -- so sometimes our own back-and-forth is a little jagged...

For this Friday's classical cartoon, a nod to our friends @CO_Symphony (Colorado Symphony). http://t.co/O3GC9sGLoL
@TylerBarton27 &amp; quickly gets into larger Qs re purpose of criticism: thumbs up/down consumer guide? Provider of context?Conduit for dialog?
@TylerBarton27 Perhaps, but one could make the argument that all criticism is subjective (and biased), anyway. /AT
6) (Last one, promise!): I'm glad to see this so widely discussed, well beyond #opera &amp; #classical. My take: http://t.co/WqE3Ix2hwg /AT
5) I ask you to read what I found the *same* critics have written recently about male singers in "less than plausible" #opera roles.
4) I still find it astonishing that no editor questioned the critics on these reviews.
3) And bad costuming/wigs -- shouldn't the designers be faulted for those, not a singer? #opera
2) is to say that cross-racial casting should also be out. That's the logical extension of a very poor argument. Happily, haven't seen that.
1) More thoughts re Erraught &amp; (contemptuous) male gaze towards women in #opera. The logical end to "physically implausible" argument...
