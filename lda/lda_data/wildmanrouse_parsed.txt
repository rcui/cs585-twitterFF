@O2 To clarify the only reason I want to end my contract early is that your poor network coverage is costing my business money.
Terrible service from @O2 . I want to move my business account to @EE because of poor web coverage and they want to charge me for it @Ofcom
@O2 yes thanks but that doesn't help. All I want to do is to move my business account to @EE for business reasons. But you won't let me.
@O2 that's done. Not just me, always other O2 users I am with. Basically O2 coverage is costing my business money and I need to be EE
@O2 no it will cost be ¬£250. Where I work in Aviemore, Wales and Essex usually no mail or web at all. My little EE PAYG works everywhere.
@O2 I just called and was told O2 will charge me ¬£250 to end my business contract early. The bad coverage locally is costing my business
@Ofcom HI, is it true that companies like O2 can no longer charge us for getting out of mobile contracts? I wanna end mine but @O2 won't !
