@aaronscotchtape I love Clerks too! The cartoon was fantastic. Incidentally, it was also something written by people other than Smith.
@aaronscotchtape I nearly spit my beer reading this.
@aaronscotchtape There are great moments, I will agree, but still, it's a bad movie.
@aaronscotchtape But it is. The writing, acting, shot composition, pacing? All busch league.

@CodyRhodes What a smooth roll-up.
Violence, conflict, aggression: these are symptoms of the human condition, but they are NOT the human condition by default.
By saying that violence is "at the heart of every man," we absolve ourselves of responsibility for our actions.
We need to distance ourselves from the romantic narrative of a bunch of "ordinary men" taking up arms and standing up to big government.
Ultimately, America needs to cure its moral cancer; a cancer that was born from its idealization of its violent roots.
The US can squash any violent resistance like a bug. All your M-16 can do is ruin lives. You're not Rambo, you're an enabler (at best).
I've got news for you, friendo: your FANTASY of a violent coup of against the US government, or any first world military, is exactly that.
...who when everytime this happens, will jump out and say "It's still my right to own guns! Without guns, the government will topple us!"

@Barnacle310 @theokcorrell I can't wait for the horrifying metaphysical discussions that Mario's sentient hat will raise.
And I'm not mad at Matt and Trey for not becoming "woke" or whatever. I can't change how they feel. Still, they're old. And so is South Park
So for South Park to keep coming out and trumpeting about how these darn SJWs are so toxic... you not exactly fighting the man, here.
...that doesn't change the fact that Trump is president. Congress is full of Republicans who wanna take away healthcare. Those guys won.
As much as libertarian white dudes wanna complain about how much social justice has taken over and that they can't do anything anymore...
And given that that attitude is what lead to our current presidential administration... it's really not anti-establishment anymore.
There's an entire community of YouTubers who make their living by bashing social justice movements and parading around their "rationality."
You don't need to wait until Wednesday night to hear a libertarian centrist tell you how both sides are dumb, but liberals are dumber.
However, things are quite different now. YouTube has completely changed our cultural discourse and how we engage in it.
Plus, with their ability to produce an episode a week, they became a soundboard of current events from a different perspective.
...not just in its mature themes and content, but its political bent of libertarian centrism, which you genuinely didn't see on TV.
So most of the culturally relevant material was still housed in network and cable television. South Park thrived bc it was different...
In the late-90s, the internet was still largely ignored as a mover and shaker of broad-based entertainment.
The problem with South Park, apart from Matt and Trey getting old and bitter, is the changing media landscape diminishing the show's role.
South Park used to genuinely fly in the face of convention and authority. Now it's just a safe space for centrist white dudes.

tl;dr: i feel lots of feels and think lots of thoughts about cartoons
Adult animated shows mean a lot to me. They've been my favorite kind of show since I watched my first Simpsons DVD.
In any case, I can be glad there are two animated shows as great as BoJack and R&amp;M existing at the same time.
BoJack is designed to be binged on Netflix, with each season its own entity. While R&amp;M is an episodic sitcom.
And really, comparing and contrasting gets really difficult when you consider the difference in mediums.
But on the other hand, is there any other show as clever and laugh-out-loud hilarious as R&amp;M?
On the one hand, BoJack is way more emotionally mature and intellectually honest about topics Rick and Morty tries to cover.
Trying to decide if Rick and Morty or BoJack is better is like being the belle of the ball and having two eligible bachelors fight for you.

In conclusion: Jhene Aiko wants you to eat her ass half-heartedly in a car while driving home because you're bored and wanna feel something.
Often, they'll finish something they bought before they even got back to the house because they were just snacking on it in their car.
And when you eat groceries, it's often in your car. It's actually one of the top reasons people overspend at places like Costco.
"Groceries" does not imply food. Groceries implies food that has been bought and assembled to be transported home.
However, with a more discerning gaze, an interesting connotation comes to mind when we consider her simile, i.e. "like groceries"
Now, through an uncritical lens, Jhene Aiko is simply requesting that a man willfully eat her ass.
I would like to, if I may, do an epistemological breakdown of the line: "but he gotta eat the booty like groceries."
