Higher maternal choline intake reduces neural tube defect risk &amp; eases baby's response to stress. #FNCE
Choline synthesis is induced by estrogen so young women need less from the diet than men. #FNCE
IOM recommends 550mg/d choline for men and 450mg/d for women.   #FNCE
Choline requirements vary depending on your genes! Important for liver and muscle function. #FNCE
90% of Americans are deficient in choline. Have you heard of choline? It's an essential nutrient you may be seeing on nutr labels. #FNCE

Q9: Have you heard about our Start with Seafood Recipe Contest? What are your best tips for hosting a fabulous party? #AD #seafoodparty
@StreetSmartRD Same! Food waste is one of my biggest pet peeves! Frozen or canned works great to avoid it. #seafoodparty
@StreetSmartRD great point! Assess cooking skills &amp; confidence in the kitchen when recommending. #seafoodparty
RT @StreetSmartRD: @karalydonRD A8: Also, cooking skill and confidence. Some are intimidated by fresh, but much more comfortable with canne…
RT @nutritionjill A8: I recommend all varieties and all forms. Want to increase intake and reduce barriers. #SeafoodParty
RT @nutritionjill: A8: I recommend all varieties and all forms. Want to increase intake and reduce barriers. #SeafoodParty
@RD_kitchen I can see why! And they're so cute too!  #seafoodparty
@LindaCornish Sounds fantastic! And what a pretty dish! Love the colors. #seafoodparty
A8: If you want to stock up, frozen or canned are great options to keep in your freezer or pantry. #AD #seafoodparty
A8: If clients are looking for ease, convenience &amp; cost savings, I recommend frozen or canned. As nutritious as fresh! #AD   #seafoodparty
Q8: When do you recommend fresh vs. frozen vs. canned seafood to your clients? #AD #seafoodparty
@nutritionjill YUM! Definitely award-worthy!  #seafoodparty
@BalancedPantry Sounds amazing! Can't wait to see the recipe! #seafoodparty

Love it! How cool! MT @stephtalksfood Does this qualify for the #SeafoodParty 😁🎣 ||! https://t.co/4qHeowWw6I
Amazing! RT @BarbRuhsRD Soooo awesome!!! https://t.co/5r5bTZ9kYM #seafoodparty
A6: The internal temperature of a fish should be 140 to 145 degrees when done. #AD #seafoodparty
A6: The fish will flake easily when it’s done, and it will lose its translucent or raw appearance. #seafoodparty
A6: Best way to tell if a fish is done is by testing it with a fork. Insert fork at an angle at thickest point &amp; twist gently #SeafoodParty
Q6: How can you tell when seafood is done cooking? #AD #seafoodparty
@StreetSmartRD Yes! I just made these smoked trout polenta bites - SO good! https://t.co/FKvIbhMpK5 #seafoodparty
Yes! So easy. RT @EWardRD A5. Canned/pouched tuna and salmon is already cooked! Great for assembling a meal vs. cooking. #seafoodparty
RT @StreetSmartRD @karalydonRD A5: For me, simpler the better. Grilled or baked is my default because the cleanup is so simple #SeafoodParty
@StreetSmartRD Good call! I'm all about the minimal cleanup! Grilling is perfect for that. #seafoodparty
A5: Broil, bake or poach fattier fish with firmer texture &amp; richer flavor like salmon or trout #AD #seafoodparty
A5: Grill or broil medium-fatty fish like bluefish or catfish. #AD #seafoodparty
A5: Depends on the amount of fat they contain! Steam or poach lean, mild flavored fish like sea bass or cod. #AD #seafoodparty
Q5: What’s the best way to cook fish and shellfish? Poach? Broil? Bake? #AD #seafoodparty
Mmm now we're talkin! RT @MoreysSeafood I enjoy sweeter dishes. Coconut flakes, almond, pineapple, mango--heavily buttered. #seafoodparty
@kitschkitch Love taco Tuesdays! I may need to partake tonight! #seafoodparty
@DianaKRice Ooooo love that flavor combo! I have a dry rub that I use on salmon. #seafoodparty
@StreetSmartRD just fashionably ;). Thanks for joining, Cara! #seafoodparty
@RD_kitchen @seafood4health haha YES!  #seafoodparty
A4: Mexican! Like the DIY fajita seasoning I used with these sheet pan salmon fajitas! https://t.co/FKvIbhMpK5 #AD #seafoodparty
@LindaCornish Mmmm fish tacos and fish burgers?! I'm ready for LUNCH! #seafoodparty
True that! RT @MoreysSeafood A3: I'm usually a frozen fish person. Life is really busy and it's a quick way to fit in protein. #seafoodparty
Q4: What are your favorite flavor combinations for seafood? Tropical? Spicy? Mediterranean? #AD #seafoodparty
@KaleQnoaCookies Nice! I always ask at the seafood counter of my grocery store which varieties are in season &amp; sustainable. #seafoodparty
@DianaKRice Frozen shrimp are a staple in my house too! So easy and convenient! #seafoodparty
@KathySiegelRDN Looks delish! #seafoodparty
RT @EWardRD Cod fillets covered in canned, drained tomatoes, bread crumbs, parsley &amp; olive oil. Roast at 400˚F. Takes 20 min. #seafoodparty
@EWardRD YUM! Is dinner at your house tonight, Liz?  #seafoodparty
A3: Shrimp and salmon are my go-to’s but I also love cooking cod, haddock, monkfish, hake and clams! #AD #seafoodparty
@joansalgeblake Me too! Thanks for joining the chat, Joan! #seafoodparty
@KaleQnoaCookies yes! So important to meet clients where they are at. #seafoodparty

Q3: The possibilities are endless when it comes to seafood. What are some of your favorite varieties to cook at home? #AD #seafoodparty
@Seafood4Health @EWardRD Yes. Love repurposing leftovers! Last nights salmon makes a perfect protein topper for today's lunch! #seafoodparty
@EWardRD love the idea of "scheduling" seafood! Yes, get it on the weekly dinner rotation!  #seafoodparty
@RD_kitchen @seafood4health Hey, Julie! Thanks so much for joining the party!  #seafoodparty
@PacificSeafood Same in our house! More like #Seafood4xWk ;) #seafoodparty
A2: Only 1 in 10 people meet the goal of having #seafood2xwk. Let’s start recommending more seafood! #AD #seafoodparty
RT @Seafood4Health A2: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommends 8 ounces of seafood/week. #seafoodparty
A2: I eat seafood 3-4x/week but recommend clients eat #Seafood2xWk for nutrition benefits! Can you say omega-3s? #omega3s #AD #seafoodparty
@AnnessaRD Hey Annessa! Thanks for joining the chat! #seafoodparty
Q2: How often do you eat seafood each week? How often do you recommend for your clients/followers to eat seafood? #AD #seafoodparty
Such an important message! MT @EWardRD A1. #Pregnant and #breastfeeding women should eat MORE #seafood, not less. #seafoodparty
RT @EWardRD: A1. #Pregnant and #breastfeeding women should eat MORE #seafood, not less. It provides many benefits to baby. #seafoodparty
@KaleQnoaCookies Yes! All great reasons! #seafoodparty
A1: Seafood is delicious, versatile, budget-friendly &amp; quick 2 prepare! Most fish or shellfish can be made in 15 mins or less. #seafoodparty

@CarleneHEA yes, versatility is key! Thanks for joining the chat, Carlene! #seafoodparty

@PondToPlate @Seafood4Health Haha TOTALLY! Love the protein boost. RD approved :) #seafoodparty
@EWardRD thanks for joining the party, Liz! #seafoodparty

RT @EWardRD: A1. I chose #seafood because it's convenient and delicious. That's two reasons! Whoops! #seafoodparty
A1: Because there are so many varieties of seafood to choose from! The possibilities are endless. #AD #seafoodparty
