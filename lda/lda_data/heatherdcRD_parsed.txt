@julestw9 hah, wow, I never said/assumed/thought I was"the font of all wisdom." Not every athlete I coach goes for time. Why so aggressive?
@julestw9 Keto? And by "better" you mean...? Faster? And you're correct, poor use of the word "essential" by science standards.

"Forward. Best foot first just in case."
@julestw9 that's a pretty close-minded statement, seeing as we've never met. Glad you read studies, as well. Really would be happy to chat
@julestw9 still curious what your nutrition philosophies are and how you've come by them. Always interested and open!
@julestw9 it means we efficiently convert carbs (glu.) to usable energy.I'd be happy to take a convo off twitter - 140 char. msgs get old :)
@julestw9 I don't think most, but definitely some, as with any industry
@julestw9 Ha, okay well that's a generalization. Many studies are sadly funded by industry, but not all. We are all able to differentiate
@julestw9 Carbs are the body's preferred source of energy. When you say "carbs" though, what do you think of? Sugar, bread, fruit?
@julestw9 not "all" - I don't belong to AND. Plenty of RDs question research/ industry msgs, just like any professional in an evolving field
@julestw9 what are your personal nutrition philosophies? how have you come to adopt them?
@julestw9 "too many them" meaning, who? There is conflicting evidence for various types of diet advice, it just depends on where you look :)
@julestw9 RDs are open to various diet advice for individuals. "eating grains" may not be your preferred way of getting carbs, that's okay.
@julestw9 some RDs have different food philosophies, but most/all examine the science before making sweeping statements. And...

@AmericanAir great. Not sure what that accomplishes... All of these passengers deserve reimbursement. And we're still on the ground..#saga
Sorry for the travel downers today, yall. Not my style, but @USAirways @AmericanAir are squashing that. Avoid their flts, you're  welcome.
@AAirlinesFail @AmericanAir six hours, four plane switches, no bags, and countless guest service fails later...we're sitting on the runway..
@AmericanAir "soon" is a funny choice of words as we've been here since 8am. They said that flt as canceled but still has our bags.
@AmericanAir @USAirways you have some of the worst guest service I've experienced in years. Assuming our bag is lost, because why not....
@RachelJWolfCA @AmericanAir yet another flight is boarding and leaving for Durango. Riddle me that... @USAirways
@RachelJWolfCA @AmericanAir six hours, which we could have made by this point. Funny story: were grounded bc of weather...
@AmericanAir they're being pretty unhelpful, just like you. Nothing makes up for spending 5 hours standing around and still being here.
@AmericanAir this is absolutely ridiculous
@AmericanAir grounded yet again. A huge group of us have now been in the Phoenix airport for over five hours with no voucher, and no way out
@AmericanAir got switched to flt 5600 which is now...shockingly...delayed. 0 for 2 today.
