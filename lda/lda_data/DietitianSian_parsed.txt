A5 #rduk using video links across sites can be effective
A5 #rduk when working with groups away from home get them to bring menus from hotels &amp; visit canteen to discuss &amp; advise on better choices
A5 #rduk I have run drop in sessions, always get booked up; 'brown bag' talks taking off where people get lunch &amp; a talk; weight loss groups
A4 #rduk provision of private health care altho' big tax implications &amp; not necessary better but convenient &amp; quick. Occ health gone 4 many
A4 #rduk has to go across whole business and from top to bottom otherwise perpetuating health inequality -need to be caring not patronising
A4 #rduk foster necessary lifestyle changes such as highlighting menu choices, offering chances to be physically active at work, occ. health
A3 #rduk Both important + other interventions like stop smoking. Make it easy like lunch time walking group, classes, sign post stairs,bikes
A2 #rduk some have to be reminded to drink e.g. set alarm on phone, good excuse to get up and move around to fetch one
A2 #rduk alcohol can be problem if part of work culture or on expenses or on own travelling
A2 Some have to be reminded to drink, good way to get up &amp; move around 2 fetch one but some drink 2 much caffeine as only way 2 take a break
A1 #rduk also if travelling on business all meals effectively taken 'at work'  need education for healthy choices eating out and in hotels
A1 #rduk stress and eating on the run or slumped over desk can affect digestion and poor relationship with food
Q1 #rduk eating well gives you the energy and stamina to face the day and perform well alongside  lifestyle factors like physically activity

#AskADietitian If it's your job at work to organise or you eat buffets/working lunches don't just order/eat the same old things - health up!
#AskADietitian Once you have visited the buffet table move away rather than hovering nearby &amp; being tempted to constantly re-fill
#AskADietitian at the buffet look for the colour like raw veg, salad leaves to balance the 'beige' food like pastry, savoury snacks &amp; fried
#AskADietitian Good weight loss programme on @NHSChoices which was created with @BrDieteticAssoc #trustadietitian
#AskADietitian 2 Portions size critical. Weigh to start with or take pics on your phone.Measure out what you need &amp; put away so not tempted.
#AskADietitian Find an activity you like to do - no point running if you hate it but love swimming. Having an exercise buddy or dog can help

#AskADietitian #BBQ can be a bit like the buffet table &amp; can be easy to over eat. Fill your plate with salad first &amp; then add other foods

#AskADietitian #BBQ fruit skewers yummy or bake bananas and pineapple in foil. Drink plenty of water &amp; organise some garden games

@NakedScientists loving your advice on vitamin supplements
@dietitianuk Don't forget you get free legal advice as BDA member. I've used a couple of times and it has been brilliant.
@blabers Go Helen with the health features. Think their answer is there are no gurantees but why not reduce the risk if you can?
First mince pie of the festive season. Removed the pastry lid and only ate bottom pastry and filling to halve the pastry and less kcal
@dietitianuk thanks
@CarbsAndCals just recommended your app as a Christmas present idea for someone
Thought I had 500g lean mince last night for 5 but only had 300g so added some lentils to the Shepherds pie - yum and a portion leftover too

Loved what PJ said about broccoli and blueberries on Fresh Meat last night- EU health claims guys might have a thing or two to say about it
Good mention of being referred to a dietitian on All In The Mind on Radio 4 yesterday
Good luck to all freshers at uni esp if cooking for themselves. Baked beans count as one of your 5 a day.Frozen veg is a great option too.
