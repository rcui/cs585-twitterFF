@PPerfect_CJ I'm really just shocked that anyone would think that was Cena's fault.
@PPerfect_CJ Say what you want - that could've really ended bad for Cena. And still may have.
Those acting as if Cena "botched" the move must be the same people that thought Finn Balor hurt himself on powerbomb to barricade.
I hate to place blame on an accident. But if you're looking for who was in the wrong - watch Nakamura apologize after the match.
@DeadonDaveV What else do you expect Cena to do? He's tucking to protect. Defenseless position - Nakamura dropped him on his head.

@LosTello Absolutely.
@kayfabe_hater I feel like that's on Nakamura. Very dangerous.
@thealy390 Yeah, I'm sure Cena didn't want to kick out after that. I hope he's okay.
I honestly thought Cena was doing a moonsault bump. When he hit, in early jumped out of my seat. https://t.co/neR5xH40sZ

@raven1220 So why you arguing with me? We agree! Haha
@TheRebelAS I heard it's a Dream Match. 🤔
@raven1220 So, is it a Dream Match or not?
@realsamnorton @TheMariaStarr We will be there!
@raven1220 If this was truly a Dream Match, they would headline Mania or SummerSlam. It's not a Dream Match.

One time, I stepped in the ring with Great Khali for "training" session... in front of Shane McMahon. It wasn't pretty.
@raven1220 All his developmental promos were directed towards Khali. They even put him with Rusev for a min. I remember.
Looks like I didn't hate match as much as many of you did. It was too long - yes. Lots of surprises to keep Orton strong but Jinder Champ.
