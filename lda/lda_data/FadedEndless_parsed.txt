If I pay for something, I shouldn't have to worry that content is going to get pulled in the future or that a service is going to end.
#DRM forces consumers to pay for access to the same piece of media over and over again.
#DRM It doesn’t stop piracy. It doesn’t even slow down piracy in any kind of meaningful way. DRM only gets in the way of legal/moral uses.

@ShadowTodd Remember the failed gansta rap attempts by MC Hammer? That's the sign something is over and dead for a while.
@ShadowTodd It won’t be over until the established acts move away from electro-pop. Rihanna trap single. T-Swift acoustic album. etc.
