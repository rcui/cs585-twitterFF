Remember to switch to A3 and include  #rduk
Q3 Can the ‚Äòat least 2/3rds plant-based‚Äô dietary recommendation help consumers to embrace healthy eating more readily? #sp #rduk

Q2 How can we communicate plant based eating as a different approach to a vegan or vegetarian diet? #sp #rduk
RT @JINutri Practicalities of getting message over that it is not about avoiding meat totally 1 of biggest problems
#rduk
RT @dietlg: A1. As well as macronutrients dietary micronutrient quality improves with eating more plant foods #rduk
RT @lecnutrition: The term #plantbased seems to be on trend but many would benefit from seeing it as a true change to their diet I agree @S‚Ä¶
