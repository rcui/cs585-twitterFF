@tkrisher You'll have to head over to the #NACTOY winners to find innovative use of high-strength steel, or come up to suite 356 for a tour!
@tkrisher Haha, Tom, only the core, frame of the 2015 of the F-150 is still steel.

Sorry for the 20-tweet, single-topic download, but had to address some issues that were being debated in my stream. Happy Friday, friends!
"strong links between...destruction of forests (with irreversible environmental damage) and economic decline." State of Forests '12
New seedlings may sequester carbon as they grow, but the vegetation and soils of old-growth forests that also stored carbon are degraded.
According to the UN Forestry and Agriculture Organization,  "Deforestation and forest degradation are major sources of GHG emissions."
Deforestation and land-use changes account for 17 per cent of human-generated carbon dioxide emissions, according to the UN Sec. Gen.
data compiled by the World Resources Institute reveals that the planet has already lost 80 percent of its forest cover to deforestation
It is estimated that deforestation contributed approximately 5.8 GtCO 2/yr to global greenhouse gas emissions
Deforestation results in immediate release of the carbon stored in trees as CO2 emissions. - UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
The total carbon content of forests has been estimated at 638 Gt, which is more than the amount of carbon in the entire atmosphere.
"The loss of natural forests contributes more to global [carbon] emissions each year than the transport sector." Economics of Climate Change
Tropical deforestation is the second largest cause of climate change in the world today.
With the loss of a protective forest cover, the soil erodes, the forest loses vegetation and local water sources become silted with runoff.
Deforestation removes stored water in the trees, which planted seedlings can never replace.
It is estimated that deforestation contributes one-third of all CO2 releases caused by people.
Fewer forests means larger amounts of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere‚Äîand increased speed and severity of global warming.
Deforestation takes away forest canopy, which blocked the sun‚Äôs rays during the day and holds in heat at night, disrupting wildlife.
Trees perpetuate the water cycle by returning water vapor back into the atmosphere, a cycle disrupted by deforestation.
Deforestation also drives climate change. Forest soils are moist, but without protection from sun-blocking tree cover they quickly dry out.
Seventy percent of Earth‚Äôs land animals and plants live in forests, and many cannot survive the deforestation that destroys their homes.
@woodlandsteward @andyheald Not to mention, it's not neutral when looking at the heavy cutting equip, processing, transport, and manufacture
@woodlandsteward @andyheald Old trees hold much more carbon than a seedling, which will take much more time to sequester what was released
Life Cycle Analysis is the only way to measure a vehicle's true environmental impact. Tailpipe phase is only 1 part: http://t.co/8fhHYncdz1
RT @EnviroMetal: As more attention is given to material impact, there is a renewed focus on Life Cycle Assessment for consumer goods. http:‚Ä¶
@andyheald @woodlandsteward you'd be hard pressed to build using wood without steel--not to mention wood's carbon release when cut.

Having a social networking identity quandary now as Google Plus resolves all the issues that caused me to fragment into multiple presences.
For me, Google Plus would require a Flipboard, Tweeteck or other multi-platform aggregator/hub for me to use it. I just don't hop sites.
Until there is an iPad app or some type of Tweetdeck integration for Google Plus, the odds of my using it extensively are slim.
