We are the defenders of everything we believe in.

We are the heirs of Liberty.
&lt;END&gt;
Fate was not cruel nor was it wrong. We are the people who will fight for liberty, inclusion and equality./19
We did not chose our fate, but fate - for better or for worse - did choose us./18
We find strength and inspiration in each other. But we must dig deep &amp; find the courage in ourselves./17
We must stand up &amp; find the courage within each and every one of us to BE the great heroes of our time./16
This is the great crisis of our time. We cannot wait for the heroes to come riding in to rescue us. This is not the duty of one person./15
And he did accomplish some great things, but we learned the hard way that most everything he accomplished can be undone./14
But we wanted that easy solution: cast the vote, decision made, rainbows and unicorns henceforth./13
President Obama warned us that one person could not fix everything. He encouraged us to be the change we wanted and believed in./12
…of the majority in the Legislative &amp; Judiciary, does not act in the interests of liberty or the greater good of our people./11
The military leaders now at the center of power, the dogmatic ideology that now steers the thinking…/10
Right now, the worst people are in charge. We briefly put our hope in a quasi-junta &amp; not surprisingly, our hope was misplaced./9
It is in those moments, when we face the mightiest foes from without &amp; within, that we see the best &amp; worst in people./8
Not every generation faces a major crisis, but ours does, and how we answer will define not only us, but the future of this great nation./7
and we oppose autocratic rule, so by definition, we fight for liberty./6
we are against division &amp; hence we are for inclusion; against corruption, and therefore in favor of ethical government;/5
But think what we are against defines what we are for: we are against hate, so we are necessarily for love;/4
Someday - none of us knows when - we're going to have to define ourselves in terms of what we are for instead of what we are against./3
These are things we must oppose with our words and actions, everyday going forward, until we take our last breaths./2
&lt;THREAD&gt;
The Resistance stands against the rising tide of hate, division, kleptocracy and the creeping menace of autocracy./1
