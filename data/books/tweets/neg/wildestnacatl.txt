@jcuvelier Sorry, I don't understand your point. Are you saying the format being different than the GP  helps or exacerbates this?
Why do PTQs at GPs not have the same format as the GP? Why not let people play what they already prepared for? Am I missing something?
@jkyu06 @pastimesonline @wizards_magic I'm sure the website says, but what format is it? (Do I need to bring a constructed deck?)

@Nickd024 They had a GP in Lincoln once, Omaha is easier to fly to than that, at least.
@Hyo2515 I'd probably just Marvel, only didn't because the mirror is dumb. I think UR is at best slightly favored against it.
@ketjak Nope, flew direct.
@bazardebagda @MagicOnline Yeah, but that card is bullshit so it's fine.
@YourHomeyDavid I admittedly did have some cool games against Marvel.
@ccbloodthirst Montreal is pretty nice!
@BenS8528 @MSigrist83 Rank the teams by how likely someone would be to compliment their draft picks.
@rhoaen I think it is generally safe to assume that no one wants you to answer with intricacies when they ask how your weekend was.
@jkyu06 Nah, that was my point. I mean my coworkers know I play, but they mostly don't know anything about the specifics of the game.
Whenever my coworkers ask how my weekend was, I just say "good" because "I got manascrewed in Canada" requires too much explanation.
@MSigrist83 @paulrietzl I dunno, @ChannelFireball or @magicprotour?
@MSigrist83 Only @paulrietzl should be allowed to do it.
@lsv Can you talk to them about making it Modern, or, better yet, Limited?

Also, I like reverting to the old PT top 8 bracket, but dislike the scaling PPs and prizes for same finish (3 vs. 4 and 5-8).
Nationals should award pro points deeper (t16? t32?), if they want to incentivize people to fly to it. One point for t4 isn't much.

@aNDy_grey @MattSevera The Limited and Modern GPs overlap, so really hope I'm not playing the Modern one.

@fffreakmtg what three Modern decks should we play?
@lsv @HAUMPH GP Orlando coverage idea: whenever someone makes a bad pick, try to guess what sort of stipulation draft they're doing.
@ZachRehf can't Scapeshift with DS: Jund uses Stomping Ground and Delver uses Bolt.
@meddlingmage because the average person attends elementary school?
@YungDug not real sold on Bant Eldrazi being a functional deck. Affinity is great, but would expect 2/3 of decks to have hate.
@WJelger please post more of these so I can "practice" sealed with minimal effort.
@Sene1 @WJelger the white is very mediocre.
@WJelger A
@JamesTheYounger @armlx I'd guess #2 is Melira, based on Ari loving Melira.
@jcuvelier is the RPTQ Standard?
@armlx I feel like you're giving me a riddle to solve.
@AntondEpinay I worry that 2/3 of your opponents will have powerful hate cards, but yeah it's definitely a self-contained good deck.
@armlx there are eight good decks in the format?
@beelang728 I'm classifying Tron as mediocre, but possible I'm wrong and it is good.
Figuring out three non-mediocre Modern decks that don't share cards has proven harder than anticipated.
@TheTiuTangClan @PVDDR (no one seemed to do that when I was in college.)
@TheTiuTangClan @PVDDR probably stating the obvious, but should look into what kind of jobs/pay majors you're considering can get.

@JacobWilson95 I hope the Vegas water utility chastises you for drinking bottled water again.
@Juzam_ Richmond is within driving distance for a lot of people, so I'd expect that to be large (for a sealed GP).
@AlexMajlaton I find it best to just agree with my opponents that I'm lucky so they'll let me move on to the next match faster.

@shaheenmtg I'm a lot more interested in this than "This Week in Esper vol. 83 (It's Still Bad)."
@Juzam_ yeah, though could also just be with this set if it is more of a general philosophy thing.
@Corey_Burkhart @Juzam_ I generally err on the side of keep in Limited, but this hand is pretty bad, so possible I'm wrong.
@Juzam_ should probably also include if play/draw, but I think I'd keep in either case.
@mtg_law_etc there was a Freakonomics a few years ago about how McDonalds provides a great rate of calories to cost (good for low income).
@AlexMajlaton yeah it is pretty medium, though someone recently animated a Dynavolt Tower against me and it was bullshit.
@AlexMajlaton did you play Lifecraft Awakening just because of Ballista, or do you like it in general?
@AlexMajlaton @rosenbergmike no, I don't have to play this Standard format ever again.  Have a sealed deck I can look at?

@OwenTweetenwald I don't actually mind the in-game play, had some interesting games this weekend, though the deck selection sucks.
@matt_alters @SamuelHBlack @mtgaaron I do think they should have a ban window then, even if rarely used, for when they miss interactions.
@SamuelHBlack @mtgaaron I assume the arguments a few weeks earlier will be, "the format is too new!" Unsure when to ban aside from new set.

@meddlingmage I think you should drop, so I can be a slightly less bad 7-1-1.
@meddlingmage if you drop, do I retroactively get the win from the round you beat me in the GP?

@bsweitz123 @MatthewNass @Smdster was it busted?
@MatthewNass @Smdster which bad planeswalker are you trying tonight? You can probably cast Sorin most of the time!
@Marshall_LR @Kengy5 why doesn't CFB have to consider that? I doubt they have a contract to run them in perpetuity.
@DanLanthier @ssomers55 @HeleneBergeot your example of them all costing $100 is a receipt for $80?
@tuliogreis possible, but seems unlikely, given that CFB wants to maintain their good name to continue selling people cards, and run GPs.
@Juzam_ so you're saying it should have hexproof?
@YungDug so if the local TO charged $10 more, you wouldn't spend $300+ to fly to a different GP out of spite?
@meddlingmage @SethManfield @efropoker yeah, we don't have to speak in hypotheticals; they've already run a bunch of events.
@meddlingmage @lsv you'll get an exclusive token of this with Luis replacing Bart: https://t.co/sPBl7HNeyo
@JDRoane @HaplessMagician sure, I guess that's my point: there wasn't "competition" from another TO either way, sans flying somewhere.
@LukasBlohon tried this deck in a few leagues and had little idea what I was doing.  This was helpful, thanks.
@HaplessMagician sure, rarely is anything all upside, but this is likely net positive.
@HaplessMagician don't the majority of people just go to whichever GPs they can drive to, of which there aren't enough to be picky about TO?
Weren't GPs basically already a monopoly?  (Can't just go to a different local GP.)  It's an issue, but I don't think it's been exacerbated.

@MSigrist83 @TheTiuTangClan @InsideMTG yeah, I think they should be wary of regularly banning expensive mythics.
@TheTiuTangClan given that there'll be only one more weekend of Standard GPs before the next set, I'd prefer they ban nothing.
@CCalcano I had to use the same document signing system when buying a house. These waivers must be pretty important.
@PVDDR I wouldn't give up my aisle seat either (at least on such a long flight).

@CCalcano is this even possible if you win every draft?
@lsv @BenS8528 sorry about that Austin/Worlds rough patch.
@lsv @BenS8528 what about these? https://t.co/RpOHbLiRQ8
@PVDDR @lsv @kaibudde well played; rephrase to "player with so many top 8s that I can't keep track."
@lsv @PVDDR what's worse: player with 8 PT T8s claiming to be unlucky, or player with 10 PT T8s pointing out otherwise?
@lsv Remember earlier when we decided it was your fault people think Cheon has no results?  Glad you took that to heart.
@grizzle_grizzle @Top8Games my wife has been watching these during her commute for the last month. Her review of each of them: "it was bad."
@Top8Games are we talking quality or volume, because Steven Seagal seems to make a whole lot of them (that I've never seen any of).
This was a good article, aside from when he insulted Dawnfeather Eagle. https://t.co/EfpZ03fAeF
Have another Aether Revolt draft up on @ChannelFireball today!

https://t.co/aMjY6E74Fh
@CCalcano yeah, needs some tuning. Add 4x Planeswalker CoCo to the main.
@CCalcano if you 5-0, will you play this at #GPNJ?
@PVDDR @kaibudde @Smdster well, I didn't ask if it'd be "the same" difficulty (obv no), but rather if it'd still be 2nd toughest tournament.
@aNDy_grey @kaibudde @BenS8528 then I would've been playing @SamuelHBlack's deck, so wouldn't factor into my narrative.
@kaibudde @BenS8528 interesting discussion, but more importantly: if I always play BenS' deck, and never top 8 GPs anymore, I can blame him?
@BenS8528 how dare you https://t.co/40nPxFASgF
@PVDDR @kaibudde It's possible: MOCS competitors are probably on avg better than PTQ winners, worse than pros.  More of the former at PTs.
@Marshall_LR also, I hope I open this pack in my Orlando sealed deck.

@lsv it's not the biggest Magic novelty check I've seen.
The finals was really well-played on both sides; great to watch. Congrats @wrapter on believing in yourself again! #CFBFire

@leearson @karsten_frank @Walaoumpa @Thalaiet the right turn being "turn 2" or are you saying it's more dynamic than that? (actually asking)
@karsten_frank sweet graphic, but as you say: small sample to be drawing conclusions. Funny that coverage kept saying Mardu beating Saheeli.
@BenS8528 @MTGRich @wrapter @lsv yeah, he just started believing in himself more. (Also, luck.)
Has @wrapter won enough again for people to start asking him "what changed?" @lsv

Props to Weitz for just scooping to the combo. At a previous MOCS someone was forced to manually Melira combo and it wasn't great viewing.
@BenS8528 @aNDy_grey Ben - when's the last time you played a video game that wasn't Magic or a Magic clone?
@Top8Games  I assume every 90s kid's answer is Fresh Prince.
Kind of weird to frame the MOCS as a qualifier for Worlds, instead of its own thing, but nevertheless, I'm excited… https://t.co/Zh71eafdlK
Rooting for @wrapter, directly against my fantasy draft interests.  #MTGOChamp #CFBFire
@aNDy_grey I'd imagine, in general, people who buy fancy $6 eggs are richer than people who buy video game consoles.
@aNDy_grey wow "level 4" eggs, you must be rich.
@P_Bear_Mtg sure, but my point was more "don't skip this based on the other Wolverine movies."
@MTGRaps I thought it was solid, certainly way better than the first one.  Liked it less than most of the full-on X-Men movies, though.
@Cybren ha, true.
@Cybren well, I meant better than the other Wolverine standalone movies, but yeah it's a contender with X2.
Logan was awesome; way better than the other Wolverine movies.
@BenS8528 @TheTiuTangClan I assume this is in response to @CCalcano's tweet. You're bad at Twitter.
@meddlingmage @OwenTweetenwald what did he do to you on his stream? Insult your trophy count?
@PVDDR where would you rank him (and the 15 other people)?
@lsv I dunno how to draft that, and don't want to learn; make it AER.
RT @JoelLarsson1991: Me and @CoreyBaumeister (maybe the most underrated player ever) is looking for a third for GP Mexico City! Any Pro out…
@evanmappleton @bmkibler one card is backwards in all stamped packs, but they never say this, so new players often think it is an error.
Now I want to do a called draft. Too late to change the format of #GPNJ?
@bmkibler yeah, though them never announcing the card thing just points out new people anyway (and creates needless judge calls).
@donaldwsjr lol feels like there should be some penalty for that.
@bmkibler people are just saying they don't like new players being asked to stand up at the start of the PT because it makes them nervous.
@kaibudde they DO announce, "count 14 cards face down..."
Ambivalent about new player announcement, but maybe start saying that one card is backwards in each pack?  See people confused every PT/GP!
@aNDy_grey @rbuehler maybe in this Twitter poll, but he's more like an incumbent in a gerrymandered distract for the HoF vote.
@rbuehler I already voted for Owen because I didn't want to waste my vote on a third party.
@rbuehler Wrapter, but Owen of options given.
@irishvikingmob @CTMagicGuy I don't think Avalanche Riders ever got new art?
@Corey_Burkhart @lsv @HAUMPH I'd rather never watch coverage again than skip a Limited GP.
Not a very satisfying answer.  Also, they reprinted three (?) of them in Time Spiral with original art! https://t.co/pAWPX684ge
Has WotC ever explained reprinting Invitational cards with new art not depicting the winner? (e.g. Ranger of Eos &amp; Snapcaster.) Kinda lame.
@fffreakmtg @BenS8528 to truly see Ben's side, you have to post your rankings and then let him get fake mad at you.
@Big_Z_MTG ah, I was hoping they knocked on your hotel room door and asked you to remove disparaging tweets.
@Big_Z_MTG as in you were approached in person, or they just messaged you on Twitter?
@mtgaaron I've only played Dishonored 2, but it was great, so I hope it wins.
@HAUMPH @wizards_magic @reddit if you could top 8 a PT on your way out, that would really help #CFBFire
@wizards_magic @reddit use @HAUMPH more (but not so much that he falls off the PT).
@rhoaen @BenS8528 my statement to Ben also applies to you.
@fffreakmtg @Mush_27 well yeah, I didn't like Plat Qing for the Quarterly events either.
@fffreakmtg @Mush_27 yeah, they are just totally different things. Also, in both cases, feels very TRGR.
@Mush_27 @fffreakmtg neither makes sense.
@MtG_King @BenS8528 @PVDDR @Marshall_LR @mtg_lee true, but as a player, that's not my primary concern. (Also, not every match can ID.)
@BenS8528 you're very old, and won a lot of PTQs, so you're probably the best source on this.  Thanks.
@BenS8528 @PVDDR @Marshall_LR @mtg_lee yeah, I like disincentivizing it, but also don't think it is some huge issue.
@bevinkoddy I guess maybe it was TO specific?  I don't think I got one in 2008 in FL.
@Kengy5 any idea roughly when that stopped?
Did they give out literal blue envelopes way back in the day? I know they do now, and term existed when I was PTQing, but no envelopes then.
First AER draft up on @ChannelFireball! Sorry for the delay, but second one is already in the queue.  #CFBFire

Played my first MOCS ever today.  Went 6-2 in sealed, Qing me for the playoff, though apparently that is during a GP.  How big are playoffs?
@OwenTweetenwald @shaharshenhar how many Yahennis do you have?
@weak_thinker card is great, though.
@weak_thinker possible it would be if it started out as a 3/3, but 2 toughness gets hit by a decent amount of cheap removal.

@shaheenmtg again, you should link to this page when referring to content posted there.
@t3hdh @fireshoes @mtgaaron I remember this being played a little in Extended, and not at all in Modern. Doesn't seem like a big deal.
@HueyJensen did you not remove the Meekstone in your p1p1 article just to see how many comments you'd get about it?
@mtgaaron should consider BBE at the same time: Jace's natural foil, and Deathrite is gone.
@OwenTweetenwald you'd have probably said, "what the hell is Modern?"
@lsv @HAUMPH shouldn't you be able to tell just based on which direction the segments overlap?
@SamuelHBlack @Corey_Burkhart should add a Stomping Ground to EE for 4 (and Ancient Grudge).

@HeleneBergeot @Juzam_ watching someone sort of Melira combo at MOCS while his opponent hoped he misclicked, instead of conceding, was bad.
@HeleneBergeot @Juzam_ I do think that it plays differently is a real issue.  e.g. Melira and Saheeli combos aren't really infinite online.
@Juzam_ I have a feeling that, despite this tweet, people are going to continue to tell you why they hate your idea for the rest of the day.
@rbuehler @_Elantris_ @YouTube sweet promo, though I'm mildly offended by where @wrapter is ordered in the "players to watch."
@tommartell he got top 5 in this millennium, though.
@cascadegamesllc ah, thanks for the prompt reply. (You may want to add that to the website so you don't continually get this question.)
@jkyu06 (I think we're the same age.)
@jkyu06 you are old, yes.
@jkyu06 @Smdster @shaharshenhar many, if I'm to believe social media.
@jkyu06 @Smdster @shaharshenhar Jarvis, did you get capped out?
@cascadegamesllc hi, question about GP San Antonio: I see where to register individually, but how do we then submit our team?
@shaheenmtg thinking you can't get in trouble because you called "off the record" is like when Michael Scott yelled "bankruptcy!"
@mattccosta to be fair, that was @BenS8528's idea.
@wildestnacatl we've now entered an alternate reality where I'm failing to convince @SamuelHBlack to add sweet cards to his deck.
@Juzam_ @BraunDuinIt @donaldwsjr @meddlingmage @CCalcano @BenS8528 @HeleneBergeot "I just had to so many FMs, I eventually got used to it."
@donaldwsjr @meddlingmage @CCalcano @BenS8528 @Juzam_ @HeleneBergeot presumably you were too busy winning to notice any discomfort.
@meddlingmage it is probably useful if you employ it regularly to concentrate, but I don't, and it isn't how we're used to playing.
@CCalcano @BenS8528 @Juzam_ @HeleneBergeot they also played white noise, which was a bit distracting.
As I enthusiastically discuss teammates' Modern decks, but have no desire to attend Vancouver, I'm reminded of this: https://t.co/6YngaLfNZD

@ReidDuke @PantheonMagic @jkyu06 wow, some school spirit.
@ReidDuke @PantheonMagic @jkyu06 will you both be wearing Dartmouth shirts, or just Jarvis?
@TheTiuTangClan @shaheenmtg Esper Poop, presumably.
@shaheenmtg well, good luck in Baltimore.
@shaheenmtg "I went 5-0 against my friend playing Mardu. Match-up is unlosable!"
@shaheenmtg surely these numbers are based on a small set of games, hence dubious of your "mutilates" claim.
@shaheenmtg I'm dubious of your outlandish claim, but yes, you did break Standard, if true.
@paulrietzl @HeleneBergeot I like all of this but lobster.  Also, putting the set on MODO sooner is good.
@bsweitz123 I think I end up with same power on the board if I cast turn 2 snake (can't revolt second time), but I agree that I'm unlucky.
@Grantlycore yeah, pretty unlucky that I'm color screwed!
@HeleneBergeot understandable, but surely, at least in some cases, there's a way to get more data? (e.g. Post a survey about PTQ formats.)

@DangerPants @CCalcano @mtgaaron @dwpoker I strongly prefer watching Limited, but realize I'm likely in minority.
@MRMLTVRS @MSigrist83 I didn't mind it then either, but I admittedly only play Std about once a month for GPs.  Maybe was bad for weekly.
@MSigrist83 the actual gameplay is mostly good, and the match-ups between the major decks all seem fairly close.
@dwpoker @CCalcano @mtgaaron yeah, I'm of course being hyperbolic. I do think the split is currently too skewed, though.
@BenS8528 @dwpoker ever heard of sideboarding?
@dwpoker well, half-joke. I do actually want them to do that, or at least have a remotely close split between GP formats.
PTQ format suggestion:

Standard for Standard GPs.  Limited for all other GPs.

(Also, change all the GP main events to Limited.)
@dwpoker @TheJoeOfAverage @SaffronOlive yeah, randomly having to test constructed "just in case" leading up to a limited GP seems annoying.
@rhoaen @Juzam_ @armlx @HeleneBergeot well obviously, but until we start using winrate as a metric, people should probably draw into t8.
@Juzam_ @armlx I think this sums it up pretty well. Too much importance assigned to t8 to risk missing, even if correct to. @HeleneBergeot

@bazardebagda sure, but $30 to $50 doesn't sound THAT unreasonable given a few years of inflation, and additional costs. Agreed $75 is nuts.
@bazardebagda I don't really know what PTQs last cost before RPTQs started, but did they have to increase because of judge payments?
@bazardebagda I think it was $50 in Pittsburgh.
@bazardebagda is Lingering Souls not good if Fatal Push is prominent? (I don't actually know what Modern looks like.)

@pastimesonline @ForceOfWill1 just sent it there, thanks for the help.
@pastimesonline (about to leave for the GP, and don't have 20 minutes to enter my deck into tool again to change one card.)
@pastimesonline the "import saved decklist code" features isn't working on your website?  Is there an email I can send my updated deck to?
@BenS8528 @TheTiuTangClan "...I had two PT top 8s and a healthy poker income."
@BenS8528 is this not hours longer than just renting a car?
@BenS8528 @JoelLarsson1991 wow, sick GP top 8 brags.
@JoelLarsson1991 the key to flying home on Sunday night is to be realistic and assume you won't top 8.
RT @Juzam_: Jund Energy updated list and my thoughts on the new nationals - https://t.co/mBcy7iBiNx
@meddlingmage ah, I didn't realize. Pretend I said: "happy birthday (metal stinks)!"
@shaheenmtg what is posted? Why wouldn't you link to the post?
@KMalsom oh, I prefer draft because it is more dynamic and skill-intensive. Can't just copy last week's draft deck.
@KMalsom stay?
@VoxPVoxD probably Avacyn Restored? I usually draft ~20x for the PT and that's it. They are all fun when you're still figuring them out.
@jkyu06 @ChannelFireball I've liked both, though a draft format has to be exceptionally bad for me not to enjoy it.
Been playing stupid constructed for the upcoming GP, but should start posting Aether Revolt drafts on @ChannelFireball next week.
@meddlingmage drafting is great and metal stinks, so sounds like you're making good life decisions.
@TheTiuTangClan @jkyu06 @pastimesonline looks like it is $50. No idea if that is normal, but doesn't seem unreasonable.
@jkyu06 @TheTiuTangClan @pastimesonline as it should be; good job Pastimes.
@domhrv yeah, I'm speaking to my experience in the US. Probably not an issue for countries with smaller player base.
@fffreakmtg @shaheenmtg @strong_sad the threshold varies by country. There isn't a universal bar.
@jcuvelier seems reasonable for it to be the same as 2 byes, but I admittedly don't know how many get to that pwp level.
@HAUMPH last time you won Regionals, a match, or both?
@HAUMPH @SethBurn @strong_sad wow, sick "Qed for Nationals" brags.  (The last one I played in was 2008, and was top 4.)
@MRMLTVRS https://t.co/x0guO5nxNK
@shaheenmtg presumably they want to limit the number of PT invites, given how many GPs there are and that even 1 extra per GP was unplanned.
@shaheenmtg yes, they are capped. Reasonable TOs will let you preregister and then refund.
Well, at least some TOs are providing refunds if you make day two. https://t.co/UsLenjP8Wr
@JacobWilson95 @simongoertzen @BenS8528 yeah, I can still blame luck, duh.
@wildestnacatl FWIW I also thought Regionals was a cool stepping stone: not quite as hard as winning a PTQ, but still an accomplishment.
@SethBurn @strong_sad no I'm pretty sure it cut to top 8 and then if you won that round you were Qed. (Unless it changed later.)
@strong_sad assuming prizes that incentivize travel, this thing is going to be the size of a GP.
You used to have to top 4 a tournament with hundreds of players (Regionals) to Q for Nationals. 500 PWP seems a bit low.
@BenS8528 I played so many Jeskai Saheeli mirrors on MODO before the PT, and they were great.
@AliEldrazi I don't remember it; do you think this is something I'd be into?!
@AliEldrazi @bmkibler @Big_Z_MTG @bazardebagda remember when Extended was just Thopter Depths and Zoo? That was great (seriously).
@bmkibler @Big_Z_MTG @bazardebagda the solution is (always) more limited tournaments.
@Top8Games in the same deck I copied an Implement with Herald of Anguish in play, so 10 mana: kill something + draw a card.
@Top8Games I've copied Blue Gearhulk, but only cast Select for Inspection.
@OwenTweetenwald yeah, you skillfully got passed a second copy of your on-color gold card.
Glad to see PTQs back at GPs, but hopefully this isn't the norm.  PTQ is capped, so need to pre-reg, but out $75 if… https://t.co/AA5KuUL32Q

@Conley81 @GameKeeperQC @dieplstks this is crazy.  Clearly should refund people who make day two.
How I decide on GP decks, featuring @BenS8528 https://t.co/0g4jh0iZti
@HeleneBergeot @bazardebagda presumably more will go if it is made worth flying to. Only people in driving distance went previously.
@PVDDR Pittsburgh is only a six hour drive from NY; see you there.
@fffreakmtg @aNDy_grey how many PPs do you need before you can downgrade someone?
@fffreakmtg @MSigrist83 @HeleneBergeot counting as a GP slot seems like it'll deter pro attendance the same way WMCQs did.
@paulrietzl yeah, if it is essentially a two-slot WMCQ, I won't go. But if it is closer to old Nats (w/ pro points, etc.), gladly fly there.
@Juzam_ (or just two days of booster draft.)
RT @bazardebagda: @HeleneBergeot @wildestnacatl are you sure? US Nationals will have over 5k people qualified :(
@bazardebagda @HeleneBergeot up next: "the return of Regionals!"
@HeleneBergeot the linked document is dated October 6, 2016.
@HeleneBergeot will Nationals also offer a small amount of pro points, like before? Makes it a lot more appealing to fly to.
Finally! https://t.co/J2N1wtxGzD
@fffreakmtg @Top8Games I've seen that deck, I incorrectly read his tweet as "Sultai Constrictor."
@wobbles @Top8Games we came fairly close to playing Thriving Turtle at PT Kaladesh.

@shaheenmtg @PVDDR it is six. Didn't you I think it was three and I told you it was six like two weeks ago?
@Top8Games isn't it just one story being shared a bunch? (Not that I think only one person has ever made this mistake.)
@meddlingmage how has it evolved?  I stopped drafting when there weren't any more tournaments.
@ReidDuke @mattccosta @OwenTweetenwald didn't you just win a GP, and are therefore rich?
@ReidDuke @MarijnLybaert so you're claiming that you DON'T pore over the Belgian Legacy Cup trial results? Yeah, okay Reid.

@samstod where does the data come from?  MODO?

@lowguppy possible in this case, but not hard to imagine a card becoming a problem sometime between five weeks and new set.

@Quick_MTGStat pretty sure it was draft at end of day one/start of day two until PT Montreal (?), then the current start of both days.
@Quick_MTGStat of course don't want you to do a bunch of work if there is little interest, but yeah that'd be cool. :)
Is there anywhere that shows PT winrates by format? I know some websites plug in your PWP, but PWP site doesn't break down rounds by format.

@shaheenmtg @JeffHoogland @CedricAPhillips just play tier 7 Grixis. @Corey_Burkhart
@kallan234 @shaheenmtg might be a couple cards off, but this is close to what I played last GP

@shaheenmtg Bob is probably better in Jund. Grim Flayer loses value without Lingering Souls. Also, you should play Abzan.
@IgniteMTG @fffreakmtg wow didn't know Rick was Estonian! https://t.co/e4Z3AxR83a
@fffreakmtg of Rick and Morty, or opaque deck names?  I like one of those.

@ReidDuke @mtgworth @MagicOnline @mtg_lee (but also please don't do that.)
@ReidDuke @MagicOnline @mtgworth @mtg_lee found the payouts.  So you get no PP for casual, and a draft's worth in competitive? Seems fine.
@Smdster competition has felt better, which is all I really care about.  (Though it is possible its all in my head and difference is small.)
@ReidDuke @MagicOnline @mtgworth @mtg_lee well yes, that disparity is nonsensical, unless you get more play points.
@ReidDuke @MagicOnline @mtgworth @mtg_lee what is the casual league payout?  Is it more overall packs?
@ReidDuke @MagicOnline @mtgworth @mtg_lee ah, haven't paid close attention.  But have had enough points to keep joining, so seems fine.
Counterpoint: competitive draft leagues are great, and the wait is still way shorter than the old draft queues. https://t.co/PRl6Cfpd6H
@ReidDuke @MagicOnline @mtgworth @mtg_lee isn't it just 8-4, like "competitive" drafts have been for years?  What's wrong with that?
@fffreakmtg @Top8Games I just peruse the Westworld Reddit. Not sure if there is a summary post there, but probably.
@Top8Games "yawn these clues were too obvious if you read Reddit posts by people who go frame-by-frame."
@Top8Games I'm still enjoying it with fan theories. It's impressive how many little hints the writers include, and that people catch them.
@SamuelHBlack @MelissaDeTora yeah, it does seem lower variance - anecdotally I see a lot of the same people Qing via RPTQ.
@OwenTweetenwald also, the tournament crashing.
@meddlingmage some incredibly old card with "bomb" in the title?
@Juzam_ @Vendilion this is sweet.
@OwenTweetenwald did you factor in the increased complaint equity if you lose on a mull to five?

@fffreakmtg @BenS8528 rather be MODO broke and happy.
@BenS8528 I nearly went MODO broke on sealeds over the last couple weeks. "Shit got manascrewed again, better start another!"
@Sene1 thanks for doing it as long as you did!
@OwenTweetenwald it is pretty clear, unless you highly value your opponents not thinking you're stupid when it doesn't get there.

@efropoker @meddlingmage just test on a secret account if you want a taste of the good old days.
@meddlingmage is your MODO name something people would recognize as you?
@meddlingmage this sounds more like "one of the worst things about MODO."
@paulrietzl I was confused by your post about Epic being great, despite inability to "manafuck" people; thought you loved doing that.
@Jonnymagic00 I filled it out, though I wish there was a "I disagree with this action" option instead of just "unimportant."

@wildestnacatl basically, does anyone know of a shorter card box? Says 2-3/4", but is really 2-15/16". Need &lt;2-7/8". https://t.co/aPIZlFBED7
@Antknee42 ah, I see. My drawers are shorter, so cards can only fit horizontally. Yours seems better for this! Thanks. :)
@Antknee42 detailed a bit more in post, but how do you store cards in it?  Directly in drawers?  800 count boxes I've tried are too tall.
@VorthosMike sorry, can you elaborate on how you store unsleeved cards in yours please?
@krokodil_dundee yeah, there are circular adhesive pads under the feet. Just slightly smaller diameter, so not visible.
Does anyone use a library card catalog to store/organize cards?  I'm looking for suggestions on how to best do that:
https://t.co/GbJVcTllQ9

@Brimaz4Life @BraunDuinIt I forgot these were different cards. #ghostdad
@Kengy5 @beelang728 @klug_alters what card is textless? (I haven't played the cube, and don't plan to, just commenting on cards shown here.)
@beelang728 @Kengy5 @klug_alters non-Jens art for Solemn is particularly egregious.
@klug_alters why do so many cards not have their original art?
@Brimaz4Life sweet - in a couple years when people get used to your new handle, they'll finally stop thinking I'm you!
@bazardebagda being able/correct to draw at 3-3 doesn't seem like a great tournament structure.
@gilessmith53 I was hoping this was some gemologist competition, then realized it was just rugby.
@Bmcgnr16 @Mush_27 @IamIncognetus yeah that's the (limited) impression I got talking to people in Scotland. Haven't been to Wales, though.
@mtgaaron @magicprotour "it's not a big deal, and it makes the players happier" is a good/sufficient answer. Thanks.
@mtgaaron @magicprotour hence my confusion. (I don't actually care if they have multiple teams, just curious how UK works.)
@vagabundomg https://t.co/HOtCu3iEO2
@mtgaaron @magicprotour isn't UK also a country?
@OwenTweetenwald it's Colombia, for people on mobile.
@AdamNightmare I would certainly watch a separate team competition between the US states.
@AdamNightmare that is almost certainly true, but would kind of defeat the purpose of the event.
@Lodestone_Golem @IamIncognetus sure, why not.  Though this did remind me that US territory (PR) has its own WMC team too.
@AdamNightmare @kaibudde nah, that would make even less sense!  (At least there is some precedent for the UK thing.)
@Mush_27 @IamIncognetus but why is that?  Because people identify as Scottish first over "citizens of the UK?"
@Lodestone_Golem @IamIncognetus this is all very confusing.
@kaibudde I'm sure they are different, but this example doesn't illustrate that: people in MD don't vote for VA governor or state senators.
@artefakt_land @magicprotour we'd have some good ones: Virginia, Colorado, California.  (I don't think they should do this.)
@kaibudde I know they are countries that form another country, but that really feels like semantics, no? US states also have own govts.
@IamIncognetus so does N. Ireland have an Olympic team?  That it is different splits for different things makes even less sense.
I am still confused why Wales, etc. have their own teams, rather than just Team UK.  Because that's how it is in th… https://t.co/dpINeanwSR
@jkyu06 not sure, would probably let @40cardfriedman pick it.
@magicbkm I don't know enough about Brazil to venture a guess. I'm not even sure what USA's outfit would be!

@MSigrist83 @tropicalsteve @OwenTweetenwald @shaharshenhar good point. Shahar please translate all of Owen's tweets.
@HeleneBergeot seems like this tweet should include photos!
@OwenTweetenwald I appreciate the updates, but dislike that they require me to have a @shaharshenhar level of flag knowledge.
@shaharshenhar @ShaunMcLaren you have twice as many followers!
@shaharshenhar @ShaunMcLaren seems like you'll get skewed results from your followers.

Also, whoever draws better.
@SFLMagic pretty neutral towards HP in general, but it was entertaining enough. My wife likes HP and thought it was great.

@MSigrist83 @mtg_lee are you in a league with the cards?
@bmkibler he looks stressed out too!
@PVDDR @HeleneBergeot seconded.
@Nacatls4Life @ReidDuke @BenS8528 @kaibudde he literally didn't sleep Saturday night at that GP; said it was to keep up day one momentum.
@SamuelHBlack @Smdster yeah, it is likely population density and time of day.
@jcho18 @BenS8528 @kaibudde he certainly hasn't tried sleeping.
@jcho18 @bmkibler well, that's true.
@MTGValkyrie @SamuelHBlack didn't realize it was for Trump until I saw this tweet.
@YungDug could be, but I'm pretty all in on Magic at this point.

@Bwienburg @bazardebagda well, it is traditionally a pretty good card against Jund, so seems fairly unimportant to have in your Jund SB.
@bazardebagda the other day someone cast Chandra against me and killed my creature, but then I cast Gideon and won.  Just like Standard!

@armlx in the same boat (minus winning with either deck).
@lsv @ChannelFireball wtf is "Azban?" Do you mean Junk?
@NerdDC seems like mostly downside for a company to endorse any candidate.
@PVDDR @Smdster @MatthewNass they can just test their Wild Defiance decks against each other.
@bazardebagda what if there are 50 Tarmogoyfs in there?
@BraunDuinIt one time at a GP, I got Thoughtseized and my only nonland was an Obstinate Baloth I couldn't cast.  I then killed him with it.
@lsv "I like that games are only 3-4 turns, plenty of time to go to Starbucks between rounds!"
@Kengy5 @fffreakmtg I didn't mind Pod being legal, but did kind of get their point banning it (just continually gets better).
@fffreakmtg we probably shouldn't be allowed to play with DRS, but yeah I'd like Twin and BBE to be legal.
@aNDy_grey if you want pro points, go. If you want fun, draft on MODO.
@noetheb @armlx @Corey_Burkhart heh, looks like we had the same thought!
@armlx @Corey_Burkhart yes, does feel like something that goes from unplayable to busted when the right card is printed, no in between.
@bazardebagda I was never that high on it (or any constructed), but I did enjoy it when I had occasion to play. Too uninteractive now.
RT @MikeSorrentin0: @wildestnacatl  https://t.co/2P4q2N2F3d
@armlx @Corey_Burkhart don't remember exactly when it was unbanned. How closely did it coincide with the printing of all these enablers?
I miss when Modern was just a bunch of Jund mirrors. Also, Twin.
@lsv @PVDDR maybe the next rotation in a year will shake things up.
@simongoertzen Ben targeted Avacyn with Liliana.
Fall in Shenandoah: https://t.co/tyKTnojSFG
Leagues are great; just did a draft from start to finish in &lt;1 hour! (The key is to either draw Skysovereign or get manascrewed every game.)
@GabySpartz Marveling into Hexplate is the same as Ulamog, right?
@PVDDR started reading Dune awhile ago at @lsv's recommendation and wasn't in a rush to finish, but now powering through so I can read this.
@GabySpartz why is this pack so bad?
@t3hdh @BenS8528 you are able to get under them with all of your cheap creatures.
RT @ChannelFireball: Even in a carefully tuned WR beatdown deck, Unlicensed Disintegration is good enough to splash for.

https://t.co/rhCN…
@lsv @MagicOnline if you have a schedule to keep, just skip Avacyn Restored.
@PVDDR yep, recorded my first one last night, and agreed that I'm more likely to record given the time savings.
@OwenTweetenwald as long as Travel Prep works, my idea of "fun deck" is available.
@BenS8528 @lsv @ChannelFireball #shitBenSsays
@Phrost_ @MelissaDeTora ah, is CL common or uncommon?
@MelissaDeTora granted I don't know most cards in Legends, but Karakas + Chain Lightning has to be one of the best packs you could hope for?
@lsv @BenS8528 @ChannelFireball videos: 2, GP: 0
Made some videos with a slightly earlier version of the Mardu deck @BenS8528 and I played at #gppvd @ChannelFireball

@primetimetara well, at least this was relatively fresh (for the squirrel's sake).
Good thing we put this squirrel snack on our porch. https://t.co/jih6WCX45r
@TheMagicMongol @PVDDR yeah, unfortunately PT players, even on the same team, aren't all in agreement on this.
@PVDDR @armlx yes, not tapping the creature here is angle-shooting nonsense.
@Top8Games @SamuelHBlack @JechtMurray @bmkibler @Juzam_ dislike.
@BenS8528 you may have to go outside.
@karsten_frank had no clue they changed the unified constructed rules until I read your article, thanks!
@Juzam_ @kaibudde @EricMTGcast well they already have optional electronic submission, though they then charge a premium for it.
@EricMTGcast @Juzam_ this is a very niche/unlikely problem.  This kid (and parent) doesn't have a smartphone?
@Top8Games @bmkibler @Juzam_  one con: makes transformational or otherwise clever sideboarding worse.
@bmkibler @kaibudde @BenS8528 @Juzam_ (the player wifi at PTs is basically unusable.)
@bmkibler @kaibudde @BenS8528 @Juzam_ which a huge number of players definitely don't, given that they are in a foreign county.
@EricMTGcast @Juzam_ why is it different at GPs than PTs? Reasonable to assume all competitors have internet access, no?
@Juzam_ seeing as they are required at the PT now, I'm hoping GPs will follow suit.
@ReidDuke @OwenTweetenwald I'd invest the energy into learning how to draft better.
@AndrewCuneo the card regularly tables, so I'll just assume this a personal attack on me.
@felibelano might be enough viewers are soccer fans that it makes sense, though I doubt most US viewers are familiar with the structure.
From FB memories. Can't say I expected to top 8 "the PT after that," and still be qualified 6 years later. Magic is… https://t.co/oSChva2KeJ
@HeleneBergeot @Big_Z_MTG @Walaoumpa @ScottLarabee I find the WMC confusing to watch; structure is unlike any other Magic tournament.
@Danzeru @BenS8528 unfavorable, though I haven't played it enough to say exactly how bad.  Liliana killing eight of your guys isn't great.
@ogbliz honestly haven't tested with or against GB enough to know, sorry.  Not playing Standard again for ~5 weeks.
@LucaMoretti14 @MatthewNass @HeleneBergeot @wrapter kinda agree,  but probably not a good precedent (wotc saying people are locked for HoF).
@SolomeOU ah, so there aren't actually that frequent, just more released for Christmas? (Admittedly kind of #kiblergoogling here)
Is there just a supplemental set in between every regular set?  Feels like it's always spoiler season for something.
@Kithkinz thanks, though @BenS8528 deserves most of the credit!
@MatthewNass @HeleneBergeot @wrapter and if he isn't, can he be, please?
@CalebDMTG @armlx @feingersh so could be guy didn't bother pushing it, rather than didn't see the exile? (Not sure if that is your point.)
@ogbliz haven't tested against GB much, so not sure.  I think Marvel beats it, but risky choice if UW is still played.
@armlx @feingersh this seems like the same thing, but I obviously don't know what was said during the judge call.
@armlx sure, though you'd think "I didn't announce the trigger because I saw him remove his graveyard" would go in the RIP player's favor.
@armlx not sure what you mean here; are you saying judge made incorrect ruling because, unlike us, they don't have overhead camera?
@OsypL congrats!
@ogbliz the deck felt good for this weekend (lots of UW), but if a bunch of people switch to GB, not sure Mardu is the place to be.
@mattccosta pretty sure just the talk show about Walking Dead is more popular than most other TV shows.
@SamuelHBlack A) how is this deck RW Humans? B) should I regret not playing RW Bushwhacker two weeks in a row?
@BraunDuinIt on the plus side, I don't have to buy wifi to see the resolution now!
@magicprotour do you get a beauty pageant style sash instead of a trophy now?
@BraunDuinIt had board right after Seth attacked with Emrakul; was crackback just lethal?
Are there any rules about physical location of your graveyard? Keeping it in line with your lands feels needlessly confusing. #gppvddr
@BenS8528 we'd have probably gone X-3 if we played Pilgrim's Eye.
.@BenS8528 Mardu felt like a good choice: played against UW six times, and went 5-1. #gppvddr #teamcfb

Old Man Logan trailer does look promising, but it's too bad we can't get the Hulk gang or blind Hawkeye driving the Spider-Mobile in there.

@AliEldrazi @HexTCG I voted based on the name I liked most.
@aNDy_grey @mtgdan @meddlingmage I really think he's saying "bigly." Last night he used it in a context where "big league" made no sense.
@freakonomics "another flaw in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance." -Vonnegut
@maro254 I preferred shorter rotations. PT formats will likely be too similar if all Standard and long rotation.
@bmkibler #bringbackBlock
@VertigoMagic nah, I liked Block. I don't like PT formats where the new set has minimal impact as much.
@VertigoMagic ah is this the thing there was a tournament in Japan for? Seems unlikely it'll become a PT format, but ok with me either way.
@VertigoMagic I don't know what that is, so can't say if I want it or not!
@Big_Z_MTG @mtgaaron I realistically meant Block, but if we're just wishing for things, I meant all Draft, obviously.
@mtgaaron any consideration of changing the format of some PTs, given that this decreases the chances of big Standard shake-ups?
This feels like I'm in a movie where I have to decide which doppelgänger to shoot. https://t.co/HAJRcv0NFK

Anyone know what is going on this weekend in Providence, aside from the GP? (Few hotels available, wondering about traffic.)  #kiblergoogle
@shaheenmtg how does it feel when you play against Smuggler's Copter?
@bmkibler @PVDDR @lsv is that why Luis was eating a calzone between every round? I just assumed it was his normal gluttony.
@PVDDR @lsv I'd also accept "the fire."
@lsv @PVDDR @WalkThePlanes "what changed?"
@klug_alters I voted for you without looking at the cubes, and with no intention to play cube. #bias

On the plus side, very happy @MatthewNass top 8ed: he was both due, and did the lion's share of the work on our deck. #PTKLD #teamcfb
@lsv @MatthewNass I even wore basketball shorts today in an attempt to channel my inner Matt Nass. (Also, it was very hot.)
@paulrietzl pretty well describes my tournament too.
Went from 8-1 to 9-7. By far my worst day on the PT ever. #teamcfb  #PTKLD #darkesttimeline

Didn't wake up at 3 AM, so already doing much better than the last PT Honolulu. #teamcfb
@_DavidOchoa @b_patisserie I understand two words in the second sentence.
RT @MSigrist83: You can make a difference. Vote @wrapter 2017. #MakeWrapterGreatAgain #LastInLine https://t.co/cQBs51FFoK
@_Telemokos not a long wait at least, given how thoroughly I was crushed.
6-2-1 with Medium Bant at #GPAtlanta. At least I get to draft tomorrow! https://t.co/k9zHL30nfd
@bazardebagda @bolov0 looks like there are flights in the morning; can just fly in during byes?
@AllFairness maybe they just misspelled "morose?"
@HeleneBergeot great, thanks!  I'm sure some of the rules could inform decisions about team composition/sponsors, so the earlier the better.
@HeleneBergeot are there any rules for the team series beyond "pick six people?" i.e. Do we all have to wear the same shirt, etc.?
@magicPJ I mean you can play current Standard and hopefully port knowledge to next Standard. I wouldn't do anything before the PT.
@magicPJ the PT for this Standard hasn't happened yet, and there will be another set/PT before that GP. Can't really practice yet.
@lsv @GabySpartz I also deleted mine, so now you look especially crazy.
RT @AffinityForBlue: This series of tweets from @Chosler88 earlier today really hit home for me. ⚡️ "Preserving #MTG History"

https://t.co…
@lsv @ChannelFireball nah, I'm pretty sure you top 8ed three PTs in a row by wanting it more (but not as much as the people that won).
@dwpoker @AlexMajlaton Allen Sun (local guy, top 8ed GP Vancouver)
I drafted seven times, and didn't get norovirus from the free Chipotle catering. A great success! https://t.co/KyZFRFMtDP
@BenS8528 @lsv @Smdster "ratings that I'd score high in are fun." #shitBenSsays
@lsv @Marshall_LR @Smdster @OwenTweetenwald "normally Luis gets incredibly lucky, but - no, nevermind, that's happening again here."
@Marshall_LR @lsv @Smdster "normally Pat does 20 damage per game, but today he didn't, so he lost." #expertanalysis
@bmkibler we can all agree that white weenie is great, though.
@HeleneBergeot that I can somehow name the 2009 World Champion really makes me wish there was @magicprotour bar trivia.
Can't wait for DC Draft Camp this weekend!  Big thanks to @AlexMajlaton for setting it up!
@BenS8528 a likely story.
(Not being facetious, this really is likely.)
@BenS8528 wow sick random draft results brags.
@lsv @BenS8528 it's good practice for Worlds four years ago, that's about it.
@BenS8528 @lsv how many cube drafts would you suffer through for a PT top 8? Even Luis' 50 is so many!
@BenS8528 @lsv it's some nonsense jackasses use to try to pick-up women with backhanded compliments.
@lsv @BenS8528 is BenS negging WotC?
@magicprotour @Sene1 thanks! Right now it just feels like you have to know all the qualification rules to properly read the leaderboard.
@Sene1 @magicprotour (oops, responded to wrong tweet before!)
@Sene1 I like how yours says who would currently be in Worlds, but they could also add that. (And maybe say which slot too.) @magicprotour
@feingersh seems that way to me too, but I don't go to LGSs enough to actually know.
@feingersh I think they want to drive people to paper prerelease AND release, though I have no clue how popular release events are.
@wildestnacatl now if they'd just start competitive drafts immediately for PT prep, we'd be all set! (Unlikely, but a man can dream.)
MODO Prereleases starting Wednesday is great: there's always a Limited GP that weekend, and it's hard to practice Sealed play in person.
@lsv wow just leaking info by posting your 0-2 deck for the world to see! #teamcfb #spies
@BenS8528 "everything is getting worse globally, based on my perception of my immediate surroundings." -most people, apparently
@davespace @wizards_magic I like drafting.
By far my favorite part of @wizards_magic is figuring out new draft formats.  Can't wait to get started on #Kaladesh tonight!
@OsypL @BenS8528 "South Florida prereleases are harder than day one of the PT." #shitBenSprobablysays
@bmkibler @BenS8528 I also thought this. #sportsball
@Conley81 @Marshall_LR @Hcorvese though I bet it speeds up the GP. Website says round 1 pairings go up at 10 AM.
@Conley81 @Marshall_LR @Hcorvese everyone gets preregistered decks; essentially everyone gets (and pays for) SiS, like it or not.
@BenS8528 I "liked" for the momentum joke, not the sick prerelease record brags.
@lsv please have @BenS8528 write an article comparing each Masterpiece's value vs. the effect of drafting it on my equity in the PT.
@meddlingmage I Meddling Maged the card revealed off of Goblin Guide a few times in Extended. #synergy
Really like removing some of the ties between PT and MOCS. Tournaments felt more like a Platinum benefit than their own thing last year.
@_Telemokos for picking tricks earlier.  Probably just pick them over creatures you could easily see yourself cutting.
@_Telemokos the seem to make more cards playable these days, like you more often ending up cutting than scrounging, so hard to get punished
@armlx @BenS8528 @lsv @_Telemokos ah, sure agreed. I was responding to Ben's "some formats are 12 or 17 creatures" comment.
@armlx @BenS8528 @lsv @_Telemokos push down creature count, you mean? Aren't most of the artifacts in your deck also creatures?
@BenS8528 @lsv @_Telemokos this is archetype, not format, dependent, right?
@GabySpartz pretty impressive that he knows the gender of all of his faceless online opponents, though.
@fffreakmtg @maro254 wow spoilers.
@lsv was the whole point of this tweet to tee up shitty Kaladesh jokes?
@SamuelHBlack what are you on?
@GabySpartz @lsv this just sounds like justice.
@lsv why?
@OwenTweetenwald this is creepy.
@meddlingmage yeah I'm not saying this is unsolvable, just that it's preferable to have everything grouped. Indy is great, for example.
@meddlingmage @CCalcano @OwenTweetenwald @Smdster @HeleneBergeot not being walking distance to anything is bad; day one finishes late.
@paulrietzl @HeleneBergeot big airport is a good one. Smaller airports without direct flights often make me skip.
@HeleneBergeot pro points, hanging out with friends, wishing the tournament was Limited
@OwenTweetenwald @Smdster @HeleneBergeot Louisville was pretty bad on #3 - almost no restaurants nearby.
@BenS8528 @GavinVerhey clearly your favorite deck is 🌋⛰⛰⛰⛰⛰⛰
@KenjiTsumura okay, Japan has the best team.
@KenjiTsumura @lsv Abzan is (medium) great.
@KenjiTsumura congrats! Who is the captain?
@prophetoftilt would a couple extra PP cause more Scottish  players to hit pro levels? I'd assume the PP typically would go unused there.
@PopperThingi if PP are meaningless there, what is the harm in adding them?
@Deadtwomtg makes sense, thanks. The US has no shortage of tournaments, so seems fine if this system just doesn't cater to us.
@Deadtwomtg fair enough.  Why is it preferable, just that it is three tournaments to play in rather than only one?
@Deadtwomtg @Sene1 do they love the WMCQ more than old Nationals (which also Qed you for a team worlds competition)?
@Sene1 is that true?  If smaller country players don't like them, then what's the point?!
@thedoh yeah, I suppose the first part of that tweet wasn't really necessary, ha.
@meddlingmage yep, that's where I'm at.  Plenty of higher impact tournaments on other weekends; can't be away every weekend.
@bazardebagda do you want to totally overhaul it, or just a relatively minor change like this to incentivize pro attendance?
@thedoh been awhile since I've had to PTQ, but that is a good point - I did used to travel that far for winner take all tournaments.
@KMalsom @ChannelFireball @lsv @magicprotour ideally I would 3-0 and Luis would get in trouble.
@thedoh this one is a four hour drive, the others I'd have to fly to.  Hard to justify time/expense for winner-take-all.
@thedoh I'd assume the points are meaningless to most of t16, but would incentivize pros (or at least me) to travel to them.
@lsv a) you told me you wouldn't go five minutes ago, b) you skipped last year when you were 45 min away.
Would it be bad if WMCQs gave a small number of pro points (e.g. 2 for t8, 1 for t16)?  Hard to justify going when it's winner-take-all.
@ChannelFireball won't be at #GPLondon, but @lsv has already promised to use his coverage powers to get me a Sol Ring at the PT.
@OwenTweetenwald @markdash12 your doing this did make me slightly less likely to WMCQ.
@BenS8528 @kaibudde @lsv @Marshall_LR @aNDy_grey Accurate.  Everyone thought they beat Tempered Steel, but didn't.
@kaibudde @lsv @BenS8528 @Marshall_LR @aNDy_grey one of those was core set draft, and the others he had Tempered Steel and Cawblade.
@lsv @BenS8528 @Marshall_LR @aNDy_grey also, luck.
@lsv @BenS8528 @Marshall_LR @aNDy_grey you lost in top 8 of Nagoya (draft); won KC by drawing Vapor Snag (the antithesis of Hexplate) a lot.
@lsv @Marshall_LR @aNDy_grey @BenS8528 Hexplate was a poor man's Scrapdiver Serpent, which was a poor man's [insert good creature].
@aNDy_grey @ReidDuke @BenS8528 if you assume you'd spend the WMCQ time preparing for another tournament, probably -1.
@ReidDuke @BenS8528 don't worry, I'm sure you guys will play Abzan and Jund, respectively, to medium results.
@CCalcano @meddlingmage @AlexMajlaton @ReidDuke I'm 0% to win no matter what, so might as well sleep in my own bed.
@Charleym_ @BraunDuinIt it is near Blacksburg, I guess that is worth some points.
@Charleym_ @BraunDuinIt I admittedly wouldn't list Roanoke as a reason VA is great (nothing wrong with it, just not a selling point for me).
@BraunDuinIt @AlexMajlaton @ReidDuke @TGCRequiem Alex spends more waking hours in VA than MD, so clearly loves it.
@meddlingmage @AlexMajlaton @ReidDuke why?  I get up at my normal time and typically still have two hours to kill before I play.
@ReidDuke @TGCRequiem well yeah, implied step zero is live in a place with 1-2 airports that have direct flights.
@ReidDuke @TGCRequiem I travel Saturday morning and Sunday night.  Just saved you two days a week!  #mtgprotips
@ReidDuke @TGCRequiem is the typical week GP prep, or is a GP a "big tournament," and you play 80-120 games even when testing for nothing?
@paulrietzl which side did you end up on in step 2?
@Nakashu_ yeah, I went after PT Nagoya. Saw the deer swarm all the children who bought cakes to feed them. https://t.co/IdzrXEadI4
@Nakashu_ Nara?
@GabySpartz @Nickd024 did I ever go to this store?
@Parker2038 probably need to be following BBD, BenS, Brad, etc.
@paulrietzl @lsv seeing as I got ~80th place, I'm admittedly not that familiar with the pro point standings last year.
@efropoker @paulrietzl @lsv "if he was one of the best in the world, he'd have played in Worlds?"
@paulrietzl @lsv might I suggest something in the vein of "I'd have made Worlds without special slots?"
@paulrietzl please pick one at random and start arguing for @lsv's entertainment.
@ronStenas @MSigrist83 @mtg_law_etc *immediately checks Sigrist's FB to see whose glasses are thicker*
@feb31st @mtg_law_etc "uh dad, towel rack."
@evanmappleton @mtg_law_etc presumably if you win both it creates an at large slot.
@mtg_law_etc how overweight do I have to be for 19?
@LukeSouthworth @meddlingmage has some weight in HoF voting, is the closest to a tangible benefit.
@LukeSouthworth @meddlingmage if it did, it was before my time.  Just been bragging rights as long as I remember.
@lsv "what changed?"
@lsv maybe you should've Twittered harder?
@BraunDuinIt I don't have a strong opinion about Worlds winner reQing, but that it Qs you for the MOCS instead is nonsensical.
@HAUMPH @lsv remember when you were more famous than Luis? Those kids don't, because they were toddlers.
@HAUMPH @lsv that was kind of a beat on our whole team, at least.
@BenS8528 @lsv @aNDy_grey I know a lot of people deferred, but I doubt the PT will be 10,000 people.
@BenS8528 @lsv @aNDy_grey now that you're in coverage, can you give me a Sol Ring like they gave you Pack Rat/Mortars? #payitforward
@lsv don't sell yourself short, I'm sure the normal quality is at least medium.
@lsv will the play and commentary also be of lower quality?
Paper Tiger didn't fare too well in #GPLouisville, but on the plus side I won the die roll for all of the rares. https://t.co/K5DwXA7s4m
@MrLanceyPants @magicprotour team is pretty much always 14. It's because there are only ~400 "players" (teams).
@OwenTweetenwald @meddlingmage lol I didn't even finish the tournament and they only tweet the top 4 teams; wasn't a dagger.
@meddlingmage oh, who is 5th?
@meddlingmage I think Sperling gets an additional Q here, but might be mistaken.
@meddlingmage it's three of each, no?
6-3 day one with @rhoaen &amp; @HAUMPH. Not great, but okay after starting 0-2. #GPLouis #papertiger
@strong_sad I have no idea if that's a thing, but if it is, I agree that also makes no sense.
@strong_sad would winning a RPTQ also Q you for the Invitational, then?
@GabySpartz but how does it taste?
@Top8Games why does the one guy not need a spacesuit?
@lsv by "tricked," you mean playing an uncoomon flash creature to eat my guy in a game, and match, I won?
@lsv @PVDDR @BenS8528 @chewypow1 if I talked @ORonHubbard into a misplay in Nashville, but he made the play, who is to blame? (Me.)
@lsv @PVDDR @BenS8528 @chewypow1 wow sick finals brags.
.@PVDDR  in Indy:
"I can tell you my Worlds rankings; do you actually want to know, or just see people get mad at me?"
"Mostly the latter."
@PVDDR please rank all of the teams (and also all of the Worlds competitors, retroactively).
@THETannonGrace that was two years ago, haven't been on camera since (apparently).
@jcho18 sick camo cargo shorts.
"You really need a haircut. Oh well, at least you're never on camera." -my wife #gplouis
@HAUMPH @rhoaen @lsv wait, you've been losing? Is it too late to find a new team?
@GabySpartz @lsv luisisabuffoonlog
@Boss_MTG this is great.
@OwenTweetenwald @JacobWilson95 @Boss_MTG @shaharshenhar yep.
@BenS8528 @OwenTweetenwald @ChannelFireball battle fox?
@AliEldrazi @mtgsalvation I have no idea if the English version is out yet (or what this card does). #nose
@AliEldrazi why'd you post the card in Spanish?  #porque
@AlexMajlaton @Nacatls4Life I bet @robonacatl or @stupidMDnacatl aren't taken if you want to join the club.
@AlexMajlaton @Nacatls4Life I assume he isn't coming, given that neither Rich nor Severa are on his team.
.@lsv  and @BenS8528 giving me shit about being a paper tiger:
"Don't know what that is, but I like the Spoon song."
https://t.co/2TKryPaSfk
Wished this article existed a few days ago, and here it is, so I guess I wish for a team limited trophy now? https://t.co/d8OsfgZYQY
@bmkibler I'd say yes, except I don't know who any of the other people it's wishing happy birthday today are.
@paulrietzl @kaibudde @mtgaaron what if I play Angel's Grace or Phyrexian Unlife first?
@AustinToler @mtgaaron I suppose I'd have known this answer, had I thought it through. Stupid colon.  Thanks!
@mtgaaron Update:I die first, and people are incredulous that I didn't know this.
@mtgaaron if I'm at 50 and use the ability on my opponent, is it a draw, or do I die first?
I wish there was an article about, or even just a list of, sweet teams posted before team GPs. #GPlouis
@AllFairness who is your team?
@TBShoward Wizards provides the product, so constructed/limited shouldn't affect entry fee much.
@wildestnacatl (the preregistered pools will speed up the tournament, round 1 just starts at 10 AM.)
Just noticed #GPATL has preregistered pools for everyone, but also costs $85 (old SiS price). Good change overall?
@bhazard17 @lsv yeah Worlds doesn't count for the streak, but the next PT (which he's not playing in) does.
@MtgMajor cool, thanks!
Does anyone know of a good sealed deck generator that accounts for print runs?  Trying to practice for #GPlouisville @rhoaen @HAUMPH
@lsv maybe with an asterisk.
@LSV I still think you're crazy for not going for four in a row. #MTGChamp
@lsv @AllFairness @Top8Games I was talking about Shota.
@AllFairness @Top8Games #teamfastandperfect
@JoelLarsson1991 @fffreakmtg how is he supposed to use those goggles? #glassesproblems
@Nacatls4Life @BenS8528 presumably @LSV is #2?
@lsv @AllFairness I don't think you're actually dead, but even if you are, I'd still prefer they show you every round.
Out of the six Modern decks shown so far, three are Medium Abzan.  Might be some @bazardebagda influence going on here. #MTGChamp
@lsv why?
@bazardebagda try "hello, I'm hall of famer Willy Edel. May I please have a playmat?"
@lsv @efropoker your deck yesterday was good, just try to get luckier/play harder today.
@willtronic yeah, I definitely don't even remember getting prize packs. I only remember you threatening my guy to give it haste for a win.
@armlx @AJSacher more like "lolmentum" amiright? (Agree with Ari that this isn't a real thing.)
@armlx @lsv @willtronic please convert into number of obsolete iPods, so we can accurately compare.
@lsv @willtronic (neither Luis nor I know if you get anything for last place in Worlds, so unclear how asinine this statement is.)
@HAUMPH at a different time than each of the other days.
.@willtronic and I won 80 gig iPods playing 2HG at the first PAX ever. That's pretty much as good as playing in the #MTGChamp there, right?
For those asking "why not Jund?," I elaborate some on this comment from @ReidDuke: https://t.co/8Dl8fOkXvh
@YoungBbile agreed.
@kaibudde @PVDDR good point, PV is on my fantasy team too.
@PVDDR but you could be practicing with the decks you already submitted!
@Time__Elemental @misterorange 9 AM was just an example (and not my time zone).  I don't care what time it is, as long as the same daily.
RT @SethManfield: This piece is a must read. @mullermtg did something very unique and special for the Make a Wish Foundation https://t.co/v…
@DysposableHero Yeah, I admittedly don't know how much overlap there is between interest in panels and Worlds.  (I only care about Worlds.)
Pretty silly that #MTGChamp starts at a different time all four days.  Much easier for viewers to remember "9 AM every day."
RT @j_hems: @wildestnacatl twitch is stuttering but the youtube stream is stable. Just type !youtube in the twitch chat to get the link
@DrKlep pretty close to unwatchable. :(
Does the #MTGChamp stream keep going out, or is it something on my end?
@magicprotour can you please add start times for each day to this?
According to my FB/Twitter, every #MTGChamp competitor is super confident in their decks/chances, but Bobby Hill is the favorite to win.
Abzan article up on @ChannelFireball, just in time for #MTGChamp!
https://t.co/k4Ipnp2QWM
@JaydotCarter3 if you have any other questions feel free to ask here or email, but article should cover most stuff.
RT @OwenTweetenwald: #MTGChamp https://t.co/JG9DYJ4a3p
@lsv who won?
@OwenTweetenwald very sporting of you to plan a party for @LSV.
@tommartell I once beat @InsayneHayne in a feature match at a GP he didn't attend. #4byes
RT @AndyCuberfauss: @wildestnacatl Goes up tonight!
Abzan article submitted. For now, check out these videos on @ChannelFireball:

https://t.co/PtdshJg65S
@davespace @BenS8528 @bazardebagda haven't tried it, but I generally wouldn't play Hierarch in a deck that is only 1/3 of its colors, no.
@davespace @BenS8528 @bazardebagda Sorry, is there a missing first part to this tweet?
Love these infographics about Worlds:
https://t.co/qHXVlMgTcn
@lsv better show up every morning at 9; wouldn't want to miss it.
What day/time does Worlds start?#kiblergoogle
@JacobWilson95 had to Google this, but one of the first results is a Vice article: "Voss Water is Bullshit," so I get the gist.
@GavinVerhey really? Which did you like better?
@shaheenmtg I do, but I'm really more of a control euthanist.
@efropoker @bazardebagda @mtg_law_etc what if you call the deck medium in the same tweet?
@mtg_law_etc several times, though I think I still lost those games.
@aNDy_grey yes, @SamuelHBlack did mention that the fourth time I posted the deck.
(Questions besides "is Grim Flayer/Hierarch/Brutality good?," that is.  Already got those covered!)
Writing an article on Abzan.  If you have any questions you want covered, now's a good time to ask! https://t.co/Sd05zWE23V
@baconmeggs one time in Florida I accidentally touched a dead, dried up lizard under my desk.  That wasn't great.
"You look like Dan Musser."
"I'm not Dan, though we do both like Zoo."
"Oh. Zoo isn't good."
"Okay."
#GPconversations #GPIndy
@erik_duhamel @BenS8528 @bazardebagda Path (and Souls) is better than Bolt atm. I think this is better, hence playing it. :)
@MSigrist83 @OsypL @TheTiuTangClan I see we've transitioned into brags about playing in the MOCS.
@mtg_law_etc @shaharshenhar @OwenTweetenwald @TheTiuTangClan Shahar was 10% to win Worlds?!
@HAUMPH @ChannelFireball the Modern GP was last week, get back to Louisville testing. #whipcrack
@OwenTweetenwald "also, it will slightly increase my equity."
@MTGLaCabra @MagicJudges not sure what these tricks are, but I'd of course love if every format went this fast.
@armlx @BenS8528 @SFLMagic @bazardebagda yeah, against Elves I killed a lord and took a CoCo.
@strong_sad I still quote that commercial whenever someone says New York City, for some reason.
@TheNotoriousBza no, but I also didn't play against Dredge. I doubt you want Kalitas when you have Path over Bolt.
@BenS8528 how do you keep replying to your own tweets? @lsv
@TheNotoriousBza it was quite good both for T2 Lilly and for helping Flayer and Vents attack.
Best one-liner in @BoJackHorseman S3?
"New York City? They make such great salsa!"
@GavinVerhey Bojack, Making a Murderer, Kimmy Schmidt
@kaibudde @meddlingmage because you think it is better than the white cards, or because you don't want to fight over white?
@meddlingmage I think I'd Faith Unbroken. This is a really good P1P1 question.
One plus side of Modern being a bunch of decks that ignore each other: #GPIndy had the fastest rounds of any GP I've ever been to!
@Gfabs5 were the cupcakes part of the prize?
@masivetwitties like I lose and they also steal my deck?
@momomoto when it lives, yes.
@BenS8528 @kaibudde and also Legacy and Standard?
@shaheenmtg you're arguing against yourself, then. If more people will show up, and they don't want that, why increase prizes?
@shaheenmtg your comments on this thread suggest you think they want GPs to be even bigger. I doubt that.
How I want my wife to wish me good luck before tournaments from now on. #Vision https://t.co/G933mFlXQ8
@GoHardBarton Hierarch is great with Grim Flayer and Vents (and t2 Lilly is dumb). I consider Rhino to barely be a Modern card.
@YungDug @Yammedup (to my friends.)
@_Telemokos "you're getting too excited."
@lsv when someone says "this card is good against the fair decks," they sure as hell aren't talking about Death's Shadow.
@magicprotour where's all the Medium Abzan?
@ChannelFireball same question; please include decks in these!
@meddlingmage oh yeah, exalted was very relevant with both Flayer and Vents.
@ChannelFireball what decks are they playing?
@BenS8528 @bazardebagda (credit to Willy for initial list, not sure just tagging made that clear.)
@bazardebagda @BenS8528 I don't think I ever cast it, but Ben played with it a decent amount online and liked it.
@SigBaldur333 usually just serviceable due to being a split card, but occasionally best card in your deck (Infect, Burn).
@SamuelHBlack #tweetrhymes
@aNDy_grey also forgot to ask how you did: X-4, X-5?
10-5 with Medium Abzan in #GPIndy. Punted 2 of the rounds. @BenS8528 went 12-3. Grim Flayer is sweet. @bazardebagda https://t.co/yBpC83YwpU
@Yammedup likely Tom, though I'm also pretty sure no one knows I won an Invi, so I think it is more that Tom is an SCG writer.
@patriotfan09 Abzan
@patriotfan09 yeah, I won. Is your friend playing Elves?
Overhead this round:"pros usually go to SCG Opens instead of GPs because they're already Qed for the PTs." Have I been doing it all wrong?
@meddlingmage Sirens of Titan and God Bless You Mr. Rosewater are my favorites. Mother Night is also great.
@meddlingmage yeah I read them all 10 years ago and reread half 5 years ago.
@GabySpartz they would be better if they were all draft!
Cat's Cradle today. There's probably some Nacatl joke I'm missing. #GPIndy https://t.co/o0WCzYPrAM
7-2 in #GPIndy. Punted one of the rounds, unfortunately.
@PDT1060 @VonnegutLibrary probably, though I'm not sure that shirt exists.
Beat Zoo my first round. 4-0 #traitor #GPIndy
Slapstick today, with bonus @VonnegutLibrary photos. #GPIndy https://t.co/F4I1YOuTDH
Going to his hometown for #GPIndy seems like a good excuse to wear Vonnegut shirts all weekend. First up: https://t.co/UUu5rnvFuU
@pastimesonline @armlx saw, but thanks for the reply. Only have my phone, so copying existing list is way easier.
@Corey_Burkhart @armlx you can just email the decklist.
@lsv suggesting you might not complete an escape room counts as a beat?
@lsv if you don't escape, is coverage doomed? Seems like you're tempting fate. Also, C+.
@armlx @pastimesonline https://t.co/ZTYLvZOqOI you can just email it.
@EEPlayerLink @armlx so would be great to have an option to copy/paste in.  But if we can just email it as text, not a big deal.
@EEPlayerLink @armlx while I like that it should prevent typo-related decklist errors, most of us just have our deck in text form already.
@EEPlayerLink @armlx @pastimesonline are you from Pastimes?  (Sorry, just don't know what PlayerLink is.)
@armlx @pastimesonline seconded, please.
@armlx wow, why is it like this?  This is harder than even being unable to copy/paste and just having to type it.
"What was your relationship with CFB?"
"Mostly getting made fun of for playing Thraben Purebloods." @Nakashu_ @lsv https://t.co/mPahTcfcoe
@shaheenmtg that's pretty crazy; you're basically the SCG @lsv
@shaharshenhar @PVDDR I know, but you have been previously, and are of the age group that I was wondering about.
@shaharshenhar @PVDDR had you previously heard of this card?
@shaheenmtg is five Invitational top 8s the most anyone has?
@PVDDR I wonder what % of Worlds competitors could answer this - card is very old and not exactly Shivan Dragon iconic level.
@ChannelFireball how dare you.
@efropoker @PVDDR Rankings of skill seem to usually be based on recent results and general fame.  Are those good metrics?
@PVDDR where are there power rankings posted? Also, please rank all of the players and tweet it.
@rosenbergmike @lsv @LukasBlohon he's #1 in complaining (both speed and quantity).
@rosenbergmike @LukasBlohon what was @lsv's PT win %?
@Cybren kind of depends how much you care about replicating tournament drafts, but if just for fun, yeah seems better.
@Marshall_LR @dwpoker the only situation I could see using this is on a short flight, but cool it exists for others.
@RossHunneds @lsv true friends Google it and pretend to be in the know (apparently).
"I get most Simpsons references. (I Google them when I think you made one.)" -@lsv
@meddlingmage at least one of the GPs is Sealed, making the decision easy.
@BraunDuinIt bare feet next to a dumpster can't be a good idea.
@aNDy_grey @mattccosta @bazardebagda and you won anyway, because Bant is great?
@lsv @bazardebagda "I incorrectly think my deck crushes Bant!"
@bazardebagda hey @lsv remember when everyone was incredulous that we played Bant at the PT?
@mattccosta @bazardebagda were you also playing Bant?  The mirror is a good match-up.

@UrzasRoommate @GavinVerhey ah right, that's the name. I always called it "Wolf-Puncher" in my head.
@GavinVerhey that Liam Neeson movie where trailer made it look like he was going to fight some wolves, but movie contained no wolf-fighting.
@lsv I love playing Modern, and have a deck that I am confident in for this weekend.
Article of the year.  Bookmarking to send to @lsv whenever he claims to be unlucky. https://t.co/WG4DxumTS5
@bloodyfaceHS @bazardebagda can potentially play Lingering Jund like Wilson.  I agree Path is better against DS, but many decks in Modern.
@bloodyfaceHS why, because of Souls?
@TheNotoriousBza @bazardebagda Anger seems pretty good right now.
@TheNotoriousBza with what split?
@dwpoker I dunno, people started playing Grim Flayer and trying to figure out why.
@bazardebagda why's that? (Feel free to message on FB if long.)
Thought Grim Flayer might be the new Bob, but #SCGINVI results indicate otherwise.  What's better in Jund?
@kaibudde @bazardebagda @Juzam_ @mtgworth he's paying for an experience that wasn't provided. Why shouldn't he get a refund?
@lsv @BenS8528 https://t.co/MiYVQytjq3
@BenS8528 just gotta suck it up for a few more days, then can draft for Louisville.
@RossHunneds Modern Open?  Or is the last sentence just an unrelated statement?
@DS_McWerp why do they say it is favored? Agree it seems like Burn should be favored.
@simongoertzen why do you think it is favored? Just because it can deal damage in such big chunks?
@bmkibler @bazardebagda Almost asked earlier if tournaments this size ever DON'T crash, but figured they must usually work.  Guess not.
@bmkibler @bazardebagda and there's the other reason I've never played a MOCS.
@bazardebagda pretty well sums up why I've never played a MOCS.
@shaheenmtg @Chris_VanMeter are you sure Narset is Standard-legal?
@shaheenmtg wait, there's draft in the #SCGINVI?
I hope @shaheenmtg wins the #SCGINVI.  Or gets Blood Mooned a lot.  #bothisokay
@aNDy_grey @lsv @bkowal23 @bmkibler first time I've heard it (or heard of this particular BK).
@aNDy_grey @bmkibler @twitter @lsv you're thinking of Brian Kowal.
@bmkibler @twitter wow you have 68k followers? You're way more famous than @lsv!
@KeaneJez @PVDDR @Sene1 ah, yeah I just glossed over first four assuming they were same as Paulo's.
@KeaneJez @PVDDR @Sene1 Brazil has two HoFers, Netherlands has four.
@PVDDR @Sene1's suggestion of Netherlands seems right after sorting the list of pros by nationality.
@paulrietzl "stop crying, you get to modestly supplement your income with Magic."
@jcuvelier probably just Bant.
@jcuvelier what format is it?
@BenS8528 well I already knew there weren't other Limited GPs, and I'd rather Bant people than play Modern.
@kaibudde @Sene1 probably misses people with one top 8, but sorting this by nationality gives a decent idea:
https://t.co/FT2S1JIoPO
@klug_alters @mtgaaron @lsv @DCDeacon @bethesda_de Luis gave me a set of these, and now they are all I use.
@lsv "I've enjoyed writing reports about tournaments that I top 8ed."
@kaibudde @Sene1 @PVDDR Germany beats France in PT wins, but "Germany" means "you" there.  Kind of took countries to mean multiple players.
@kaibudde @Sene1 @PVDDR might not be, but I can name more French players.  Might be a lot of famous Germans before I started playing.
@Sene1 @PVDDR top 3 seem pretty clear to me.  Haven't really looked at stats by nationality, but 4-5 certainly sound plausible.
@jcuvelier who are you teaming with?
@jcuvelier Rich Hoaen and Paul Cheon
@PVDDR this is currently, not historically, correct?  What would your top 5 be historically?
Just checked the GP schedule - disappointed to learn that I won't be Banting anyone before Standard rotates.  At least there's Team Limited.
@shaheenmtg remember when we played in the last Modern GP and I Blood Mooned you?  Modern is great.
@TJCollectibles do we still have to show up at the player meeting at the same time if we get the $30 pre-registered pool option?
Is the sideboarding bug people have been tweeting about MODO-wide, or only in Leagues?
@lsv BenS and I are going.
@Parker2038 I don't play, so not sure, though I did see some wallaroos in the wild.
Spent the week in North Queensland visiting the Great Barrier Reef, Undara Lava Tubes, and Daintree Rainforest! https://t.co/DS0I8CIDy4
@BenS8528 to be fair, I just showed you the picture in person: "hey it's me watching you lose a GP, FB memories is great!"
@armlx @MattSevera @HeleneBergeot well, you're flying within the US, so there's no possible way it's necessary. (I'm not sending it.)
@lsv @aNDy_grey @HAUMPH if only someone had advised you to check on internet when selecting flights. (Also, this counts as complaining.)
Not having wifi on your flight and having to sweat if your friend won the quarterfinals for three hours is some crap. #ptemn @lsv
@Jonnymagic00 does it block it you to go through the app? I think I've watched top 8 on United before, but may be misremembering.
Just caught myself thinking, "can Luis just get lucky in top 8 for once?!" @lsv 's nonsense is rubbing off. #PTEMN
"Sorry I can't help you prep for top 8."
"Whatever, I'll just Bant them." @lsv
@lsv @BenS8528 this morning: https://t.co/8iZPGtl2bt

2-1 with one of the worst decks I've ever drafted at a PT. #luck #teamultrapro

@Top8Games yeah, we watched that on flights to/from England last year.
@Top8Games yeah, we downloaded the first seasons of Mr. Robot and Orphan Black.

@armlx yeah, I assume it is so early for coverage, but I don't think I've ever had my 75 settled by then.
@bazardebagda would it be unsportsmanlike to place lures near other teams' testing houses?  (That is a thing you can do in the game, right?)

Had a dream last night where the morning of the PT they assigned each competitor a theme deck that they had to force. #mtgnightmares
@Top8Games @kaibudde nah, Kai got outplayed, and also you guys are enemies now.
@JoelLarsson1991 I really thought this was going to be a photo of a lute sitting on the edge of a fountain.

@jkyu06 are you only allowed to add an East person if you find a West person too? Would mess up the graphic otherwise.
@mattccosta Hall of Perpetual Silver?
@RubinZoo are you not voting because you don't think any of the candidates are worthy? Or something else?
@rosenbergmike @SamuelHBlack as long as cutoff is after most recent PT, I don't think it is a big deal.  A few GPs unlikely to affect votes.
@lsv *exaggeratedly points to baby's blanket as exiting the car*
@thedoh @UkuMagic as do I, nothing saying you can't do both. :)
@brock_parker wait why did you let them capitalize your name?  You just blew your shot at the lchof!
@thedoh @UkuMagic so is most of your interest in the pro scene aspirational?  I was interested (but less) in the HoF before I was on the PT.
@dwpoker @SamuelHBlack a valid point.
@dwpoker @SamuelHBlack easy way to ask the question of the 50 people who know what he's talking about.
@Top8Games also don't know who that is (make mine Marvel and such).
@Top8Games I don't know that person or acronym. I've also never seen Orphan Black, though did DL for Australia flights.
@Top8Games at least one has to lose, that should be some good fodder.
@Jahha_AIE @BraunDuinIt yes, but there is nothing pushing you to retire from Magic.  Why not let people keep playing if they want to?
@UkuMagic do you care about HoF? (Just curious.)
.@Sene1 apparently @nabe1218, @CCalcano, &amp; @ReidDuke have played every PT since the first one they Qed for? #mbn
@BraunDuinIt I'm sure plenty of athletes would keep playing if their bodies let them.  No such limitations in Magic, so why not?
@PVDDR @MelissaDeTora agree, though I more meant there are a lot of people close in stats, so it'd be hard to choose between them.
@paulrietzl do pure casuals follow a bunch of pro players?
@MelissaDeTora @PVDDR maybe this is the disconnect: I do think voting would be hard this year if you wanted to use all five slots.
@bmkibler they are promoted by fan-made spreadsheets every PT!
Idea for next year: send the stats to all candidates a week before ballots, and ask them to verify information is correct.  #mtghof
RT @ReidDuke: Please, very important to correct the #mtghof stats page as quickly as possible. @wizards_magic @HeleneBergeot @ScottLarabee
@cardhoarder " ...based upon the player's performances, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, &amp; contributions to the game in general."
@cardhoarder See others' reasoning for their ballots, hear from peers of players before your time or don't speak your language, etc.
@OwenTweetenwald how many PoY top 10s do you actually have?
@CedricAPhillips @SethManfield @jkyu06 voting immediately without seeing/having any discussions is pretty bad.  (Site being wrong is worse.)
RT @Sene1: This spreadsheet might be neat-o for finding PT stats for potential HoFers (though no HoF ballot filter right now):
https://t.co…
@Sene1 well-deserved, seeing as you track the stats better than they do.

@OwenTweetenwald @GenghisGrill can you actually finish a large bowl there?  Should've gone with Luis instead of Phil.
@GabySpartz can't click the link, but your deck seems great based on the image in this tweet.
@PVDDR what was the lawsuit?  First I've seen you post about this.
@wildestnacatl also seems info about when you can arrive/leave was inaccurate: just says must arrive within 6mo, and leave within 3mo.
Just got my 400 visa. Took 3-4 workdays, for those still waiting.
@Nacatls4Life @MSigrist83 still have 20+ days, so probably not.
@MSigrist83 @bazardebagda I agree with the rule, just saying I think it'll be used more for EV concerns, rather than visa ones.
@bazardebagda and anyone with just one invite, right?  (PTQ winners, GP top 8ers, etc.)
@bazardebagda I'd think most people are using the visa as an excuse to defer, rather than the actual reason.
@MSigrist83 wow, punished for submitting promptly!
@MSigrist83 nah, I submitted before either of the FAQ emails.  (Though I did get everything else correct.)
@bab4m yeah, if Johnny Depp can't bring his dogs, I'd imagine anthropomorphic cats are off limits.
@GabySpartz had this happen ~3 days before a PT so I just bought a new computer.  This tweet reminded me I should get the old one looked at.
@MSigrist83 well, that's a good sign for other ETA applicants.  (Though kinda BS that I submitted before you and am not approved!)
@Nacatls4Life @shaheenmtg I wonder what the odds are that you two play the same deck at the PT.
@Corey_Burkhart having done this for years, I think the key is to move to DC so all of your GP flights are direct and under 90 min.
@BraunDuinIt @shaheenmtg maybe if you're going to a PT after. (Though that's still 9 hours longer than my Australia itinerary!)
@shaheenmtg @BraunDuinIt one time in France @AliEldrazi and I were the last to board, but they still found time for a "random" check.
@shaheenmtg I don't think most grinders travel 24 hours each way for a GP.
@GavinVerhey Ben Franklin. My wife has a lot of BF paraphernalia.

@shaheenmtg grats!
@magicprotour I really hope @shaheenmtg plays against someone named Esper.
@shaheenmtg what's your record?
@ZdayMTG what format is it?
@mattccosta @ReidDuke I'm rooting for WotC to confusing him with his Brazilian lookalike whose team goes X-3.
Really wish there was some coverage to watch in the background while I do housework all day, but I guess @EverySimpsons will suffice.
@shaheenmtg that seems worse than this 10 hour direct flight.
@shaheenmtg also why didn't you just drive to DC and fly direct?
@shaheenmtg what's going to have a longer travel time: Brazil or Australia?
@lsv @markdash12 @HAUMPH Tara suggested we get this for you, but you'd already bought it yourself.
@Smdster @lsv yeah, I'm sure it varies, but every year when I lock up Gold I just think "sweet, another four chances to win a PT."
@Smdster @lsv because that's lots of chances to win?
@lsv one time I tried to describe this game to @HueyJensen, but @OwenTweetenwald kept aggressively correcting me, so I gave up.
@PVDDR "How'd you lose your hand?"
"Freak tiger accident.  Totally unavoidable."
@OsypL have you seen other stuff from the creators, or just based on the trailer?
@aNDy_grey once I had to decide between playing in Nationals or sitting on rating and being Qed for next 2 PTs. Didn't win a match in Nats.
@Brazz99 @aNDy_grey yeah, you're getting the same number of invites with more options. Seems like all upside.
@JoseCabezas_pok I guess we'll just have to see once the site comes back up. Doesn't look like this is an official account.
@lsv @ReidDuke @ChannelFireball will he change it up and actually review the cards? Or still just shitty puns?
@JoseCabezas_pok already applied for the 400, which I'd hope still works, but that is pretty comical if true. Going to create more confusion
@BraunDuinIt not sure it is yes even with an appearance fee, since an Australian company isn't giving you the appearance fee. Shrug.
@efropoker @BraunDuinIt certainly possible I filled it out wrong, but I'd guess either answer works given that the letter explains it.
@efropoker @BraunDuinIt I don't get an appearance fee, and somewhere on the site it said prizes, etc. don't count. So I said no.
@BraunDuinIt maybe that you're being paid to participate in the event?
@BraunDuinIt I didn't even get this page and I completed the application. Must've selected something dif earlier. (No clue who is right.)
@GDBeSportsLaw and if it isn't for tourism, does that meant I need a tourist visa in addition to stay for a week after?
@GDBeSportsLaw do you happen to know how long before/after an event you're allowed to stay? Or do they always grant three months regardless?
RT @GDBeSportsLaw: @wildestnacatl I am willing to help answer any pros questions re best I can for free if you want to spread the word.
RT @GDBeSportsLaw: @wildestnacatl @ShawnKornhauser hey guys I'm an Esports attorney and I have a lot of exp with visa issues. I can help
@HeleneBergeot okay, thank you. I called the visa office, but the guy didn't seem to understand my question.
@GDBeSportsLaw already have flights and submitted application though, so I guess I have to just see if they approve at this point.
@GDBeSportsLaw  awesome, appreciate the offer. Not sure I have an issue, just can't get an answer on how long I can stay.
@HeleneBergeot Helene do you know if there's a restriction to how long you can stay AFTER the event? (Email mentioned one week before.)
@lsv does this count as a Magic card? @evergeneva
@HueyJensen sounded that way to me, but also that you need to explicitly ask TO.  May want to ask visa office about it.
@ShawnKornhauser I think it can if you get another letter from GP TO.  I'm very glad I'm not going to the GP.
@ShawnKornhauser I called the visa office, but the guy didn't seem to get what I was asking, so didn't get a straight answer.
@ShawnKornhauser I hope it is more than that for other peoples' sake, but one week before and after would cover me, luckily.
@ShawnKornhauser 400 is the short term work they told us all to get (might be different for non-players, don't know).
@ShawnKornhauser are you on the 400 too, and that's what the visa office told you?  (Fortunately that would exactly work out for me.)
@lsv @paulrietzl babies sleep a lot, I'm sure you'll find the 4-8 hours to deal with this.
@paulrietzl yeah that was me last night.
@paulrietzl no one at your job can provide proof of employment for you?  Isn't that a normal thing for apartments, loans, etc.?
@paulrietzl I said none of the above where you said "amateur sporting event" I assume. Get a letter from your boss, or maybe pay stub works.
@MSigrist83 @HueyJensen @BraunDuinIt the website is going to be down for like 12 hours overnight, it hasn't been down at all yet.
@paulrietzl you can use driver's license instead of birth certificate, got a letter from HR, didn't claim to be amateur.
@paulrietzl the most recent WotC email has all the info about the business numbers and stuff.  All the other info just facts about yourself.
@BraunDuinIt @HueyJensen I don't know, the guy didn't seem to understand what I was asking in general.
@HueyJensen @BraunDuinIt the guy wasn't very helpful, but seemed to say they pretty much just grant the time period you ask for.
@HueyJensen @BraunDuinIt I am finding out now about how long you can stay (have a vacation planned after).  Will tweet when I know.
@HueyJensen @BraunDuinIt the email said you can only arrive a week before event, I don't read that as the same as you can only stay a week.
@BraunDuinIt presumably you can, but would need a letter for that.  WotC just sent an email FAQ.
@AustinToler looks like I'm okay on both ends then, thanks.
@bmkibler people playing in the GP and arriving earlier than Friday need an additional letter from that TO. Glad I'm not going to that.
Apparently this visa stipulates you can only arrive a week before the event. Anyone know if there's a limit to how long you can stay after?
@Nacatls4Life It says in the original email that you need to request it.  There is a list of info you need to provide them.
FYI for those still waiting: I received the visa invite letter from WotC, so they are working on them now.
Typical conversation with @lsv over the last two days:
"Did you have a kid yet?"
"Nope."
"Okay, let's complain about visas."
@Walaoumpa @mechalink @HeleneBergeot @MSigrist83 am I missing something?  Why is this relevant to the application?
On a lighter note, I watched "Bart vs. Australia" the other night, and I stumbled on this awesomely esoteric tattoo:
https://t.co/eqqu2m4w86
@bazardebagda @misterorange 20 is still a lot, given that it could be close to zero with advance notice.
@MSigrist83 @fffreakmtg though I asked for it at 11 AM Sydney, so not clear if it has to be forwarded from someone at WotC US or what.
@MSigrist83 @fffreakmtg I don't think anyone who requested this yesterday has received. It's 2AM in Sydney, letter is from Australia office.
@HeleneBergeot @MSigrist83 Another to address: "does my SO traveling w/ me need to be on my 400 visa?" (This is why I called, they said no.)
@MSigrist83 @HeleneBergeot ...now needed this 400 visa instead, and the lady didn't say anything about that being an issue.
@MSigrist83 @HeleneBergeot didn't explicitly ask, but I called the visa office and mentioned that I had the tourist visa and...
@bazardebagda @SamuelHBlack you've already submitted the application, right?  Seems like you should (narrowly) be okay.
@wildestnacatl also, anyone who has already applied - do you have the Business Registration Type and Business Registration ID?
@bazardebagda @BraunDuinIt yeah, I don't know why you'd risk this.
@DrKlep there is a special visa that takes four weeks that WotC told us about five weeks before the PT.  The normal visa takes 5 min.
Not sure what's worse: needing a special visa to play in a Magic tournament, or WotC just telling us about it now.
@PVDDR @Big_Z_MTG @OndrejStrasky you should keep the rankings on Twitter too, in case you forget.
@lsv wow perfect timing to name her after one of your preview cards, so Geneva can't search Gatherer.
@GabySpartz I thought this was the name when it was first printed.
@allimmmiles yeah, I'd be very paranoid about crashing even a normal bike, despite that never happening when riding fully clothed.
@paulrietzl there are only two GP weekends left; I doubt there will be much more movement before the PT
@LouisKaplan86 @armlx like just have the top card in your pile of drafted cards always be a random checklist card?
@armlx I forgot about the sleeved thing.  Are we just going with "unsleeved, but try not to look" in practice drafts?
Meld cards seem unwieldy to physically tap/untap.  They should all just have vigilance!
@allimmmiles that super tall bike seems scary to ride even fully clothed.  How do you get on/off it?
RT @Sene1: So the four leaders in the GP PotY race are now within 1 point of each other. Also, sheet updated as of #GPPitt R15:
https://t.c…
@PVDDR I have no idea who is in the lead for either of these, and presumably I'm more invested than the average viewer.
@PVDDR yeah, I like how it keeps things interesting past the GP cap (which I also like, compared to higher point thresholds).
@Marshall_LR yeah, that's less interesting to me.  Can't have written coverage on in the background while doing stuff around the house!
Will there be coverage of #gppitt? #kiblergoogle
RT @BenS8528: @fffreakmtg The problem is people don't know how to use the fire to properly get them in the zone.
@fffreakmtg thought it was pretty silly you were tweeting about disappointment in GP results when you just t8ed a PT; glad to see you agree.
@paulrietzl become a TO?
@OwenTweetenwald @hm how do you know it's of great quality after wearing it for 15 min?  Continue review after a few washes. (Please don't.)
@Lambach @HeleneBergeot I took her response to mean they recognize only before PTs is not enough, not that they just want to change dates.
RT @HeleneBergeot: @wildestnacatl We have considered when building the 2017 schedule (it'll be announced at Sydney)
RT @HeleneBergeot: @wildestnacatl We acknowledge that although it was not by design, the concentration of Limited GPs before the PT is far…
@Lambach @HeleneBergeot they are currently almost all the week before PTs, meaning just one per format.
@aNDy_grey I'm not going to listen to this, but I will play the original song in my brain.
@HeleneBergeot request for next update: reasoning behind reduction in number of Limited GPs, and if that will continue next year.
@HueyJensen ballots were sent out in July last year, so presumably starts soon.
@lsv @PVDDR
"a) Luis always plays that fast, b) blocking is all downside"
[Teammate loses dragon that would've killed Luis' guy next turn.]
@PVDDR had something exactly like the Serra example in a team draft: despite my protests, teammate called @lsv's "bluff" and was punished.
@PVDDR @AndreasPischner there's probably also something to having a better attitude is more conducive to networking and improving.
"I watched Brad Nelson pee." @fffreakmtg https://t.co/Rp2cPCf3K8
@LukasC88 @Big_Z_MTG yeah, looking through the thread, I didn't actually see any pros (by my definition) called out.
@Big_Z_MTG maybe people are conflating pros with semi-pros/grinders?  I have observed more poor behavior in the latter.
@jkyu06 @_megafone_ @mtgzen just plan an Australian vacation during that time either way.  #solvedit
@jkyu06 clearly it is still worth it to be Gold for next year, just curious.
@jkyu06 if you get Gold in Montreal, will you last minute go to Sydney?
@jkyu06 @ReidDuke @FoundOmega yes there's one for every set the week before the PT, which many pros choose to not attend.
@jkyu06 @ReidDuke @FoundOmega there would have to be Sealed GPs for this to help you get Platinum.
@BraunDuinIt @shaheenmtg @PVDDR they usually have a pairing system for stragglers.  Hope you speak Portuguese!

My wife planned an awesome surprise birthday adventure today. I'm sure glad I didn't go to a stupid Legacy GP! https://t.co/3i5r6dJLYH
@Jonnymagic00 https://t.co/GpBjxZcdkc
@bmkibler inappropriate.
@jkyu06 I assumed it was "because you would've won since you're so great at Legacy."
@lsv @MatthewNass is this the thing where you offer to help him test, but instead make a deck full of hate cards, wasting everyone's time?
@mattccosta (no dumb pun about the Silver pro level intended.)
@mattccosta hey, still a silver lining.
@jkyu06 oh right I forgot there was another Legacy GP that I was smart and skipped.
The best part about already locking Gold is that I don't have to play any Legacy this season. #GPCol
@meddlingmage was this an important match? If not I'd be more inclined to think this is awesome than tilt.
@lsv @aNDy_grey F, not close.
@lsv just in general, adding "not close" to a statement is not very useful.
Good write-up of the Blue Moon deck we played at the Modern GPs: https://t.co/twZmu777VQ
@InfiniteThorn B-, and yes.
@aNDy_grey one recently opened near my work, though there are very few in VA in general.
@shaheenmtg @shaharshenhar https://t.co/rDaZOV2psU
Been seeing a lot of posts about how awesome Costa Rica is, so I got the "Costa Rican Blend" at Wawa.  Was just okay.
@shaheenmtg @shaharshenhar could just check when you got to the airport.
@shaharshenhar @shaheenmtg presumably the GP website can answer many of them!

@kaibudde @mtg_law_etc is playing the bullshit version of Dryad Arbor unethical?
@lsv @BenS8528 top five and bottom five drafters on the PT. Or just a bunch of flavor judge questions.
@Juzam_ I don't get cutting Limited GPs because they're bad for coverage, but then not covering many GPs. Just have Limited w/ no coverage.
@lsv it's no GDD + AV, but still pretty good.
@fffreakmtg @lsv Worlds (presumably the same thing you're after)
@lsv would you lock in 11-4 right now?
@bmkibler yeah, I always hated that crap.  Part of why I've gravitated to finite run comics (Fables, Y, etc.) as I get older.
@bmkibler Captain America has also died before, so seems like the typical attention-grabbing nonsense that will soon be reversed.
@lsv @OwenTweetenwald wait so you're saying a HoFer already knew what tempo was before asking Twitter?
@magicprotour thank you for announcing this with ample time before the PT.
@kaibudde Can send you what I played in GP NY, but haven't played any Standard since (and not playing this weekend).
@mtg_lee @fffreakmtg "who is the best pro?" mostly implies playskill, whereas this asks for best combo of playskill/deckbuilding/drafting.
@fffreakmtg so who has the highest combined deckbuilding and drafting skills?  Probably Team Rietzl.
@pastimesonline great, thank you for the prompt reply!
@shaheenmtg seems like a good place to link to your FB page.
@pastimesonline I preregistered for #GPMinn, but am no longer attending. Is it possible to get a refund, please?
@bmkibler @BudLightEsports what do you get if you win?  Free lifetime supply of Bud Light?
@SamuelHBlack this might be better than Sam Black 7000: https://t.co/l4RWooSW6A
@shaheenmtg @kaibudde @PVDDR GPs all being &gt;2k people probably already indicates that people want tournament Magic.
@WhoMeDrewSki not sure, presumably just an oversight. Could check with @JVLTMS looks like he posted them.
@momomoto 20 points, so not really trying for it, probably taking it easy til the PT.
@YungDug saw you ended up winning/cashing, GJ. Looks like only half the draws cashed.
@momomoto played Twin until it was banned, and this sort of played like post-board Twin. Was pretty fun.
@WhoMeDrewSki thanks, congrats on Qing for the PT!
@Corey_Burkhart but have you considered how many more cards you could've drawn with GDD?
@AndrewCuneo @ReidDuke was he playing his Modern deck?
I drew so many cards. #GPCharlotte #BlueMoon https://t.co/Dra3UWOUH8
Locked up Gold! 12-3 at #GPCharlotte with Blue Moon. @paulrietzl is smart.
@seeknayr40 how? Urborg looks like its own distinct card, not a Swamp.
@HaplessMagician bullshit.
7-2 at #GPCharlotte and up way past my bedtime.
@wildestnacatl unrelated to this tweet, the match next to me got into an argument about whether the Arbor is bullshit, or "strategy."
@JackRNewhouse @bmkibler worse, though I also hate that.
@Pandabeast24 I assume it isn't possible to ban a certain version of a card, but was definitely a mistake to print.
The Dryad Arbor that looks exactly like a foil Forest gets me every time. #GPCharlotte
#GPLA and #GPCharlotte are three time zones apart, and are likely to start round five at the same time.
@bmkibler @SamuelHBlack it worked until round 4, when I played a 1-2.
@TBSdash @HueyJensen "Californication," if it counts.  I guess "California Love," if it doesn't.
@lsv just realized you can steal Jeskai's Emrakul with AoT ultimate, so obviously hope that happens.
@KevGrove @lsv yeah it is something like $100 for five years here.  The last two times I entered the US, it took &lt;5 min.
@lsv not having precheck (and global entry) is a pretty big waste, given how much we travel.
@lsv do you not have precheck? Do you sleep til 830?
@lsv @HeleneBergeot can't you just wake up at your normal time for 8AM? That's what time my flight is for every GP!
@BenS8528 @ShitBenSsays @magicPJ Bruce's comment from 2013? https://t.co/phJIJlZiZ8
@Nacatls4Life unsure if semi pro is a dagger, or an accurate description of how much Magic is my profession.
@MagicOnline @MSigrist83 holy shit Sigrist's win % is high, even factoring in the age of the account.
@patriotfan09 hopefully you don't run out of space first. :)
@patriotfan09 I'm at most GPs that aren't on the west coast, so I'm sure we will cross paths eventually.
@patriotfan09 Grand Prix, though I didn't know there was a Modern Open this weekend, so I'll have to check out the coverage, thanks.
@mtg_lee @MagicOnline @wizards_magic thanks!
@MagicOnline @wizards_magic is there a summary somewhere of the formats and schedule?
@ReidDuke @lsv yeah, I don't think it is.  Both will be the biggest thing in play, and have the relevant creature type.
@ReidDuke @lsv it is a good card, but pretty replaceable by other 5s, and you don't need many 5s.
@ReidDuke @lsv depends on the deck, but Neonate is much more likely to be an important card in your deck.
@ReidDuke who is nobody?
@MariusHollenga not sure, seems good when you turn into bad mid-range deck post-board, but not great when trying to combo g1.
@jmmoore_ haven't tried it yet, but Bushwhacker Zoo might be okay.
After testing Modern this week, I've come to the conclusion that I wish Twin was legal, so I could stop testing Modern.
@MariusHollenga yeah, I got it from my father, then gave it to my wife.
@PVDDR @DrKlep I got it last month. You continually throw up for a day, then can't move for four days. Wouldn't recommend.
Not sure how they convinced Ben to do this, but if you want to get better at draft, you should probably watch.  https://t.co/OXCHncxnbe
@kaibudde @lsv @mtgworth @paulrietzl based on my cursory glance/making up ages for competitors, Luis will be the oldest player in Worlds.
@lsv @mtgworth @paulrietzl you've drafted formats that Martin Muller wasn't alive during, but sure, "level."
@efropoker @paulrietzl so, flashback drafts?  My wish has been granted; that was easy!
@paulrietzl same (but replace "Worlds" with something I'll ever play in).
@TheBG_D I wish!
I love the idea of a year of flashback drafts on MODO, but in practice they just taunt me while I test for mono-constructed GPs.
@bmkibler recently some kids stole our doormat and left a note that said "your stupid."
@HAUMPH I've noticed that people new to the gym use it more. Might be because it's relatively obvious what it's for vs. other machines.
@MarijnLybaert I've seen, and made, plenty of complaints. But less lately, since it seems like the price is here to stay.
@jkyu06 @armlx @Good_Game_ @AlexMajlaton I'd be interested.
@donaldwsjr honestly have no idea, haven't played since the bannings. But I'd imagine Nacatl Burn is better, sadly.
@paulrietzl @OwenTweetenwald oh, they will be (but I still don't care that they are the same weekend).
@donaldwsjr yeah, I'll be in Charlotte.
@lsv is this tweet an example of tempoing Twitter?
@KoubekVojta @lsv I meant in the KP KC top 8.  He certainly cast a lot of ill-advised Scrapdivers and Hexplates.
@lsv I top 8ed a GP by going to Scrapdriver Serpent into that double strike + lifelink enchantment.  Jealous?
@lsv did you ever draw or cast Scrapdriver Serpent?
@lsv Vapor Snag + Scrapdiver Serpent = the perfect tempo deck?
@Juffuffles @kaibudde @ReidDuke @thepchapin how come?
@kaibudde @ReidDuke @thepchapin they are good for coverage (same people every year), but very bad in terms of fairness.
@kaibudde @SamuelHBlack @bazardebagda yes, which is why I ultimately played mono W.  But these would be the 2-3 lands in the SB, not main.
@SamuelHBlack @fffreakmtg @bazardebagda agreed that that is the bigger factor.  I doubt you want any non-mono white spells.
@fffreakmtg @bazardebagda you just said it was relevant!
@fffreakmtg @bazardebagda what do you need/want Unmaking for?
@lsv "My GP slots are full, but I'm not Gold" is the opposite of a brag.
@tropicalsteve it should be on official website where the post Magic Online decklists.
@tropicalsteve It 5-0ed a competitive league last week (_megafone_), not sure of exact date.
@xPLANESWALKERx that's true, though I need less points this time.
@bazardebagda Ah, didn't see that, thanks.  Red has to be better, right?  Hits for two more by default, and Always Watching double pumps.
Didn't have time to try it, but still wondering if this is the best way to go for SB lands. https://t.co/b9em7nSfnw
Went 10-5 with WW at #GPNY.  Technically two points from Gold now, though practically need a three point finish, since my GP slots are full.
@lsv @wrapter @MatthewNass you'd likely have had the same record had I said nothing.
@_megafone_ @Juzam_ @karsten_frank @ChannelFireball lol nah it's your deck, I suggested they look at it when they already had.
@shaheenmtg sick!

@lsv I lost too. Does that mean it doesn't matter which deck I chose?
RT @ChannelFireball: There are tons of great dining and entertainment options near the venue at #GPNY! https://t.co/2afea60z2D
@lsv @wrapter @MatthewNass I'll only accept blame for the former. https://t.co/1QOaVyr2k6
@YourboyinDC Camtasia
@fffreakmtg did you mean to type this Into Google?
@lsv [fast forward 3 days] "why do I run so bad in GPs?"
@lsv sounds like you're really keeping your eye on the prize (Worlds).
@lsv you know none of those GPs are SOI draft, right?
@SamuelHBlack @BasicMountain @PVDDR most people who get in are 300+, right?  I think the other changes would be more impactful.
@PVDDR I think it is fine, just less stuff for outside viewers to keep track of if they are the same number.
@PVDDR do you think the voting threshold should be 250 as well?  (I do think it is cleaner if they are the same number.)
@AlexMajlaton sweet, do I get his pay also? (@AndyCuberfauss may want to check this.)
@OsypL the answer is obviously X-Men!
@GavinVerhey we did this on Team CFB once.  I won the draft, so it seems like a good system.
RT @WizardsNorman: @wildestnacatl Pat Cox Invitational, everyone sits around talking about Jund, then drafts.
@misterorange you then play 10 rounds of stupid Constructed!
I enjoy discussing Constructed way more than playing it. There should be a tournament where you explain your Standard deck, then just draft.
@YourboyinDC Chantilly is closer to me than downtown, so no real issue on that one. :) Hoth was bad.
@mtg_law_etc sure, though isn't this the suburbs of NY? Doesn't seem that egregious, compared to say Boston (Worcester).
@T0MSIM0NS yeah, I'd assume this location is much more affordable for players.
@OwenTweetenwald ah, I'm driving.  Did you consider doing that instead?
Keep seeing posts about #GPNY being in NJ.  Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I don't care where I spend 36 hours indoors.
@GabySpartz @ReidDuke @ChannelFireball so like Harbinger of Tides?
@OwenTweetenwald a testament to your skill?
@ReidDuke @GabySpartz @ChannelFireball I can't make the seminar; can you just tell me what to play in Standard now?
@rhinocoin_ yeah, route just cut off my hotel from the site, when I could've easily booked a different hotel, had I known.
@Andifeated_R I'm sure some of it is 6-3 being nigh dead for prizes; not sure what the normal no show rate is.  (Seemed like a lot, though.)
@rhinocoin_ not sure; could certainly be the case.  Though either way, no reason TO can't post about road closures when you're signing up.
@mtgdavids that is not advance notice.  If they'd posted on GP website or social media, I could've just booked a hotel that wasn't cutoff.
@squash86 yes, or known anything about it when I asked later.
Large number of players weren't present for rd1 of d2 of #gptoronto. In future, TO/WotC should give advance notice of marathons or similar.
@GabySpartz @lsv send all complaints (and flavor judge rulings) to @BenS8528
@cplatt87 yeah, I started 0-3 after byes, so happy enough with my final record. Sorry you missed day two.
@MagicJudges @HeleneBergeot Rob once beat me in a PT, then offered me some pizza, then top 8ed the PT.
@meddlingmage @Good_Game_ @magicprotour the only match that could actually go that fast is Luis/Shouta.
@aNDy_grey @GabySpartz you take that back.
@efropoker @lsv I wish they gave half a pro point, so I could take another one next week.
@magicprotour wow spoilers.
@lsv "luckily I can still complain about my loss of 'complaint equity,' whatever the fuck that is."
@lsv you already know the story and I don't want to complain on Twitter (that's your job).
@MariusHollenga I went roughly 3-3 at my first GP, also with no byes.
@MariusHollenga is that the 15-0 guy? I'm not greedy, I'd lock 12-3 next week right now!
@Mush_27 I did. Metagame actually seemed better for it, though I drew much better at the PT. :)
@MariusHollenga thanks! Plenty of GPs left, though ideally just one more.
Finished an unimpressive 10-4-1 in Toronto. Now 3 points from Gold, with one GP slot open. #gptoronto
@aNDy_grey lame.
@SethBlack53 was unaware Path existed, thanks. Ended up just getting up early enough to bypass closures (didn't see tweets til now).
@SethBlack53 *south
@SethBlack53 Renaissance, it is connected to the Rogers Centre. Sour of Front St., which is closing.
@thedoh I tried, lady had no clue aside from that there was a marathon.

Can someone please tell me the round/time at #gptoronto?
@Andifeated_R not TOO big, thanks!
@magicprotour how many players are there?
@lsv are you sure? Did you forget you had a "bad pack" in a draft you 2-1ed?
@lsv @armlx @Smdster yeah? Well how'd THAT work out for you?
@BraunDuinIt the closest hotel I found was a mile away, but on the plus side, I'll get all my Fitbit steps in.
@rbuehler rooting for @GabySpartz, based on great deck choice.
@kaibudde @bmkibler just first 200 players or is it an invite-only thing?
@bmkibler Hearthstone has GPs?
@lsv @Marshall_LR you're complaining about how you top 8ed a PT, and we're the curmudgeons?
@TonyCharizard possible Make a Stand was good for the PT, but seems like there will be a lot of Languish now.
@lsv no, that's asinine.
@lsv to anyone who gets WW in the PT Gauntlet: congrats on your good fortune, WW is great.
@benfrenchman @HAUMPH and you could stream it for zero wasted time!
@HAUMPH just eating one giant meal a day sounds most efficient.
@Cardboard_Crack @lsv has 7 top 8s.
@donaldwsjr I don't think there's anything aside from the obvious (need sleep in special and byes).
@Nacatls4Life I don't think that is necessarily still the case.  Sounds like it will be announced in Sydney.
RT @HeleneBergeot: We have heard your feedback https://t.co/J0nhPxnBCG

@jkyu06 @lsv @klug_alters everyone on any deck at the PT thought they had a good WW MU (they mostly did not).
@lsv @klug_alters you had me buy 40 Gryff's Boon, then said, "nevermind we added Ulvenwald Mysteries to the main of GB and it's great."
@lsv @klug_alters I tried. https://t.co/RhtZbKZnBd
@AndreasPischner prerelease
@lsv @klug_alters do I side in Ulvenwald Mysteries in every matchup, or just ones where I want a dead card?
Often after PTs, I'm asked to write about my deck, but don't have time due to work. You want some pros' only job to be Magic. #paythepros

@joshuamilliken haven't tested it against the top 8 or anything, but it was good in the tournament.
@lsv @aNDy_grey @GabySpartz yeah they showed this one guy who played really fast and perfectly. I think his name was Shouta.
@paulrietzl on the bright side, we got to play WW in the PT.
RT @paulrietzl: Just landed back in the US basking in the glow of hitting platinum, did I miss anything?

RT @fffreakmtg: https://t.co/bzYFyZPr7U
@kaibudde @meddlingmage @HueyJensen well, even if at PT1, shouldn't have announced it in the middle of top 8.
@Juzam_ @Big_Z_MTG @PVDDR Hasn't the number of Worlds slots changed before?  Not sure how there's a "hard cap."
@rbuehler @kaibudde @Juzam_ ah, well might be even less now, given the lack of incentive to get exactly Platinum.
On the plus side, I do like Ireland and Japan.  Any US location is interchangeable, but good for me, given finite vacation time.  #PTSOI

@lsv @kaibudde yes, obviously.
@kaibudde @lsv when I told my wife Luis top 8ed, her response was "so does that mean he'll stop complaining?"
@lsv you went to 5 GPs and are locked for Worlds.
@kaibudde @Juzam_ @bmkibler gold gets flights too.
@LukeSouthworth @bmkibler Nagoya was June 2011.
@bmkibler we apparently haven't been in "8 years, since Chiba" (Nagoya was 5, Chiba was 6)
@kaibudde @Juzam_ I think 30-40?
@Juzam_ yeah, should've been announced at the start of the season, at least.
Seems like Platinum change should've been announced further in advance. People expended time/money earning it; now worth way less. #PTSOI
@lsv do you think gogo will refund me for this wifi that I only got to watch you win the PT?

@lsv @HAUMPH @ChannelFireball I'll save you both some time: play UW Eldrazi.
@aNDy_grey Also would not be surprised if the random flyers won you more games than the 8 drop.
@aNDy_grey I don't think the double splash is unreasonable, but may not be needed.  I'd play Tightening Coils and probably Aggression.
@aNDy_grey do you have any cheaper cards you can play?  8 cards at 6+ CMC seems like you'll just get run over some amount of games.
@kaibudde they made a blog post asking people not to do it.

@lsv @BraunDuinIt Apparently only cashed 4 PTs in 4 years, but if you want to go back 6 years, you cashed them all.

RT @ShitBenSsays: "Would you cut off @ORonHubbard's hair for 5 pro points?" #shitBenSsays
@OwenTweetenwald top 4ing with 4 and 5 pools is only a 7.5 in luck?
Went 11-2-1. Unfortunately slightly missed Qing @ORonHubbard and @DavidSharfman, but happy to get 4 pro points. #GPDC
9-1-1 after an unintentional draw with PGO and win so far today. #GPDC
@lsv wow I got really lucky to beat this masterpiece.
@lsv @ORonHubbard @DavidSharfman #duh
8-1 going into day two of with @ORonHubbard and @DavidSharfman! #GPDC
@Nakashu_ who is your team?
Waze supposedly has the closures incorporated, so try using that if driving this morning. #GPDC  https://t.co/CYOnKNyO3C
@NerdDC this photo is only moderately creepy.
@NerdDC going to wear your shirts?
@NerdDC Saturday and Sunday starting at 9 at Washington Convention Center.
Pretty excited to team with these guys for a hometown GP this weekend! #GPDC https://t.co/IF3oOKRrDq
If Living End is considered the "forces of good," you know Modern is messed up. @ChannelFireball https://t.co/H8yPOVI6RK
@shaheenmtg @rbuehler this sounds awful, but they should have a Draft League.
@mattccosta well yes, using it on your own Drowner is great against every deck.
@kaibudde I don't think UW crushes it or anything, but felt about even in the matches I played online and at GP.
@mattccosta why is Displacer an all-star vs. Company? All their guys having coming into play effects.
@mattccosta @kaibudde UW has 7-8 1cc removal main, and Gutshots in SB. Doesn't seem like a match-up Infect would hope for.
@Tolaria_DWest okay, no problem. Thanks for the response.
@meddlingmage @OsypL @philnaps thanks to earlier tweets, we even know your Sunday brunch plans.
@starcitygames cool, thanks! Any chance of a preview article of notable teams on Friday?
Is there a list of all the sweet #GPDC teams somewhere, or do I have to glean the information from Twitter?
@lsv @mtgaaron I doubt any Expedition is worth more to you than the complaint equity you get from not opening one.
@MariusHollenga no worries, someone else figured it out.  Thanks though!
@beelang728 ah ha! Would've never figured that out, thanks!
@MariusHollenga I see a "select all," but not "show all."
Anyone know how to unhide cards I have hidden in a sealed build, please? #kiblergoogle
@bmkibler @JacobWilson95 @HeleneBergeot have they ever gone anything but up?  (And if not, why is this an issue?)
@MadtownLems @lsv @GabySpartz Only saw the finals, but it's good if you want to see Luis repeatedly suggest a bad play and Gaby correct him.
@OwenTweetenwald @HAUMPH I think he just misspelled it as "Control." He got the UW part right.
@kaibudde Yeah, meant others. Knew you were playing, because I remember embarrassingly missing a Huntmaster trigger while you watched at PT.
@SwitchGlitchmon I had it in my sealed deck at a GP; presumably I caused some opponents to do that.
@kaibudde @paulrietzl @OwenTweetenwald what about a 3/3 that makes a 3/3 every turn?  (This was a real card, for people not playing then.)
@mtgblogger1 probably Eye. I could imagine TKS and Smasher being playable in a less dedicated Eldrazi deck with Temple around.
@mtgstaples I doubt the deck can survive in its current form with one sol land. You already have to mulligan so much to find one of two.
Best mirror tech I faced: Displacer + Shriekmaw. #GPDetroit
Playing 7-8 Eldrazi pseudo mirrors was admittedly more interesting than I expected (but they still need to ban something). #GPDetroit
@damagedirect @BrianArruda84 I'm partial to "Glow."
7-2 at #GPDetroit. Random tidbit: Alien Ant Farm is playing at a vaping convention next to the event hall.
@wildpepsihat thanks!
Anyone know round time in #GPDetroit please? #KiblerGoogle
@lsv @shaheenmtg @PVDDR I was happy you were getting use out of it!
@shaheenmtg @lsv @PVDDR left lights off to not wake up Shaheen and forgot a shirt. He's just wearing it next time I see him.
@lsv @PVDDR #elitistpro
@aNDy_grey @GabySpartz presumably to make his hands look bigger?
@ORonHubbard @lsv @MatthewNass also in my eggs. That place loved ham.
@lsv @markdash12 @browndr @MatthewNass wild guess (based on seeing you do this a dozen times).
@browndr been offered chitlins by a coworker a few times, but did not partake ha.
@lsv @browndr @MatthewNass "...until I ate Matt Nass' unwanted waffle."
@lsv @MatthewNass why would potato chips come with, nevermind on, a waffle?
@SamuelHBlack TOs, mostly.
@SecludedGlenn @GavinVerhey feedback: I wish #GPDetroit had tri-corner hats.
@Juzam_ Mostly seems unreasonable because it is a departure from the standard.  I wouldn't have even thought to check.
@wizards_magic ah okay, will #GPDetroit have anything similar (e.g. the escape room)?
@wizards_magic will there be Magic tri-corner hats at #GPDetroit, and can I have one?
@Nakashu_ smart.
@GavinVerhey wait was I supposed to make some joke about  people confusing GP/GOP?  #GrandOldPrix
@GavinVerhey there's a GOP debate in Detroit this weekend? There was one in Houston last weekend!
@ReidDuke @mtgaaron I can't believe you've considered Soul Sisters.
@OwenTweetenwald is it wrong to hope this is considered an invalid submission?
@OsypL @AndrewCuneo he does very clearly state that it is "awesome with mana."
@GavinVerhey my vote for Serial assumed season 1.  I like upgrades more than season 2.
@shaheenmtg trying to avoid any chance of another stressful win and in?
@shaheenmtg just play a League like a normal person.
@TrickMTG Wild Nacatl on turn 1.
@paulrietzl did you watch the show "Rome?"
@HeleneBergeot @GabySpartz pretty sure the average height of Magic pros is &gt;6 ft (dragged down by me).
Good write-up by @thepchapin on the Jeskai Black deck we played in Houston #GrixisWhite #NotGreen #alternatenames

@lsv @GabySpartz @Marshall_LR C-
@lsv didn't you join 4+ PTs ago?
@shaheenmtg ugh.
@shaheenmtg nevermind, it came back just in time to watch you get horribly mana screwed.
@BelisarioMoran my impression was that he knew, but was hoping to distract his opponent into missing triggers.
Just tuned into #BoMMadrid to see a guy randomly blinking things instead of conceding when his opponent has inf life, inf damage, inf scry.
@shaheenmtg that's what you think.
@lsv @wrapter did you use a playmat or not?  #elitistpro
.@wrapter and I used playmats at #GPHouston yesterday, unlike @lsv.  #elitistpro
@mondragon everyone else was sold out!
@CCalcano okay walking out not sure which terminal yet.
@paulrietzl because my guys have flying, or I'll be flying home tonight? (Presumably the latter.)
@CCalcano split an uber?
Landed in Houston; just need to find some Abzan Falconers and I'll be ready to battle! @lsv #GPHouston
@lsv @inkwell_looter @py__ duh because I live near the Mason Dixon, get your heads out of the gutter!
@SwitchGlitchmon @lsv it's not his paper, and someone will always give him more. #elitistpro
@lsv you expect random strangers to provide you with tournament supplies. #elitist
@tommartell @SamuelHBlack @mtg_law_etc (I also don't think this is some unsolvable issue. Just providing example of what Matt was saying.)
@tommartell @SamuelHBlack @mtg_law_etc no it couldn't, Sam is the subject of the sentence.
@YungDug @lsv nah, it is an unnecessary thing to carry. I also hate how they often encroach on others' space.
@IamIncognetus yeah, it was funny in its over-the-topness. He kept it in his bag til he made the emblem.
@lsv @SamuelHBlack Luis asks someone around him for a single piece of paper every round.  It is asinine.
@kaibudde @BasicMountain @paulrietzl (also guessing how old he is that he knows that.)
@SwitchGlitchmon I have quite a few from ~2006 that I'm sure my opponents would be suitably unimpressed with.
@kaibudde @BasicMountain @paulrietzl guessing exactly how rich he is that he can ruin cards with wild abandon.
@BasicMountain @paulrietzl Apparently if you use a playmat, people will assume you're a rube, so pick your poison.
At a SCG Open a few years ago, Sharfman used a GP trophy as his Venser emblem. Don't remember if he used a playmat.  #signaling
@lsv @Marshall_LR will I level-up to Platinum if I listen?
@SamuelHBlack @mtg_law_etc "Sam met Matt at the place, then he did something" refers to Sam. "They" would refer to both, or be ambiguous.
@SamuelHBlack never thought I'd enjoy reading an analysis of playmat usage.
@SamuelHBlack I'd certainly concede there, but I guess you gotta eke out that League value.
@BraunDuinIt this was before ever dreaming it, though luckily someone had turned in my priceless BR Vampires deck.
@BraunDuinIt I periodically dream about losing my deck right as round 1 pairings are going up. (I actually did this at Worlds 2010.)
@SamuelHBlack @kaibudde @OsypL mine too, though I then assumed it was meant to dagger Nassif.
@MacStonePhoto oh hey thanks for letting me know you're in town. We're even from the time I didn't know you lived in Greenville! @NerdDC
@Top8Games I was on a flight with John Lewis on my way back from PT Atlanta. Coincidence? (Yes.)
@SamuelHBlack @HeleneBergeot was this not something that came up for old-style PTQs?
@SamuelHBlack @rhoaen @Nacatls4Life I think we can all agree that Limited is nice.
@SamuelHBlack @Nacatls4Life not sure of the reason, I'd guess size or wanting to avoid appearance of TRGR.
@Nacatls4Life @SamuelHBlack you could've chained the first two PTs and still not have that many points, but either way this is a corner case
@jcuvelier I know this isn't a court of law or anything, but seems crazy that they can change the offense and not allow you to defend.
@gabnassif if they changed the offense, are you not allowed to write a second appeal?@jcuvelier
@lsv @JhoiraArtificer I assume the Mexican food thing is determined by liking your periodic photos of 5 lb burritos?
@JhoiraArtificer @lsv @Marshall_LR well, at least I now know 24% of my followers are worth $0-$100k, so I can tweet accordingly (?).
@lsv @Marshall_LR @JhoiraArtificer how the hell does it know my followers' net worth?
@ESP_MTG @meddlingmage I wonder if this is the smallest one yet.  The only one I've played in was ~34 people, which was crazy enough.
@meddlingmage I'd have guessed NE would be smallest (but not that small); also wouldn't have flown not direct. Flying to biggest is brutal.
@HeleneBergeot "I wish I'd gone to Nebraska!" -things @meddlingmage never expected to say
@AlexMajlaton I'd assume that is Rietzl/Sperling or Luis/Cheon. We might've had a shot circa 2011.
@AlexMajlaton Orrin and Sharfman
@AlexMajlaton who's your team for #GPDC?
Addition of Sealed Leagues is great; right in time for #GPDC too.  Now if they'd add some more Sealed GPs, I'd be all set!

@Top8Games @WalkThePlanes we tried to watch season 1, but it is too depressing.
@mattccosta @lsv what did you play, some Consecrated Sphinx crap?
@lsv @mattccosta "you guys top 8ed a PT together 5 years ago, so I assume you're best friends."
@shaheenmtg ah, and yeah I know him from when I lived in FL.
@shaheenmtg where was the RPTQ? Anyone I know Q?
@mattccosta you?
@JeffHoogland ha didn't you do well in Modern yesterday?
@mattccosta Orrin and Sharfman
@twerkrobot like inside that gross sac thing?  Sounds horrifying.
@thedoh yeah, if accumulating pro points weren't a consideration, I wouldn't play Modern again until bannings.
Excitement level for upcoming GPs:
Houston (Standard) - Medium
DC (Team Limited) - Very High
Detroit (Modern) - Should I cancel my flight?
How many rounds are the monthly MOCS typically? Trying to figure out if I have time to play. #kiblergoogle
@YungDug @ChannelFireball yeah, that's probably about the 6th card I'd take.
@ChannelFireball War Cleric
RT @lsv: @wildestnacatl "but you gave this card a 2.5 and I won a game with it, so it should be a 3.0"
@lsv "hey LSV I just wanted to say that I somewhat enjoy your set reviews!  Keep up the okay work!"
@lsv what's the Twitter equivalent of disabling your wall?
@WalkThePlanes aren't they only covering ~1/3 of GPs now?  Could just not cover Limited, especially if attendance is higher (per @Sene1).
RT @Sene1: @WalkThePlanes @wildestnacatl Limited GPs are on average larger than, for example, Standard GPs, even not counting Modern Master…
@nerdtothecore @WalkThePlanes no, WotC provides product.
@pie15301 @WalkThePlanes I love watching draft.
@WalkThePlanes ah, only saw the "played" graph. Though maybe that indicates people like it to switch things up?

@simongoertzen Yeah, I don't like how Limited GPs are the week before a PT and never again.

@bmkibler "jokes on you, I have a chump blocker for your next Smasher!"
@paulrietzl was Rochester ever a PT format when they had video coverage?  Sounds miserable to watch.
@emidln So that could be solved with a commentator that is better at drafting, maybe?
@emidln I've admittedly haven't seen it in many years; why is it so bad?
@vpgorman @OwenTweetenwald They should ultimately do what viewers want, but I know what I'd much prefer to play.

@lsv @GabySpartz @aNDy_grey perhaps you've never heard of @ShitBenSsays?
@lsv @simongoertzen it's good if you Bonesaw into it.
@PVDDR that I'm 9th most likely to win makes me somewhat dubious of these calculations, but still fun to look through.
@lsv at least you have plenty of dead cards to discard to your looter.
@bmkibler no clue, but they didn't used to end for sealed until ~5:30 anyway.
@bmkibler Was it ever possible to make top 8 in Limited and take a Sunday flight?  Could certainly make a flight after Swiss tonight.
@lsv I also don't use F2 or F8.

@grizzle_grizzle yeah I didn't look at your side of the board, both halves look miserable to do online ha.
@grizzle_grizzle @paulrietzl I'd previously never make someone click through the combo, but I approve of making this person do so.
@paulrietzl Well, that's encouraging.  Though that one guy sounds like a real asshole.
On the plus side, I'll have a lot of time to test this weekend when I'm snowed in. On the minus side, the banned list on MODO will be wrong.
@lsv All of the cards I named are good in draft.
@lsv I unwittingly helped you prep for this episode:
"What's good in draft? ...You're just naming Rares."
"Actually, those are all Mythics."
@lsv will this affect my ability to make my Saturday night flight?
@Top8Games there's one of these near me; had no idea it was a chain.
@meddlingmage I assume it is to highlight the new set, but I wish there were some a month or two in as well.
@lsv pretty nice of them to write "possible" instead of "incredibly likely." https://t.co/JV6OT1oUZq
@Smdster @BraunDuinIt good call on day two being longer, hadn't thought about that and am about to book for upcoming GPs.
@shaheenmtg what's in Seattle?  Isn't the next team GP in DC?
@lsv @mattccosta @thepchapin Not sure of his actual name, but didn't "JWay" top 8 a GP with that deck too?
@armlx well, one of the old issues was pro points based on standings, and that is still fixed here.
@BradDavis711 @PVDDR there's a couple of threads on the front page of the Magic reddit.
@KangaRod apparently, according to people on this Reddit thread (that I doubt were aware of another Borbrygmos).
@PVDDR Agreed.  I didn't even know there was another Borborygmos!
@OwenTweetenwald why?
@OsypL I'm watching Modern because it's more relevant with the upcoming PT, but dunno if that's a common reason.
@lsv @BenS8528 @MTGdad @Marshall_LR "should I go 0-3 for $200, or drop to preserve my lifetime win %?"
@NerdDC oh good, I can use all the French I know here: un pain a chocolat sil vous plait.
@armlx @HeleneBergeot yeah, I liked those too.
@armlx @misterorange not sure it is actually any harder than learning a draft format. But draft is great, so please don't get rid of it.
@OwenTweetenwald @lsv @_Elantris_ I suggest your preview card for an upcoming set, so @evergeneva can't find it in Gatherer.
@lsv I assume I have you to thank for this mystery novelty gift? https://t.co/vhRzLGpJWI
@WalkThePlanes I once watched @AliEldrazi's son repeatedly throw the Nicol Bolas one on the ground, so I guess he's no match either.
@OsypL eh, delayed to make Cat's Cradle seems like a worthwhile trade off.
@OwenTweetenwald @BasicMountain @AnotherSalieri I thought you deserved a Pulitzer for "Owen's Pick of the Week: Atarka Red."

@kaibudde ah, so worst card to top 8 in the specific deck, but not objectively worst.
@AndreasPischner @kaibudde interesting; yeah I didn't know any of these cards before now.
@kaibudde that is great.  Also this card seems to do nothing even when castable, so presumably is the winner.
@kaibudde what was the reason for playing a card they couldn't cast?
@shaheenmtg @BraunDuinIt wow, sick top 9 brags.
@paulrietzl @MishrasFotoshop even just releasing on the current day, but with normal queues, would be great.

Played poorly against Amulet, but managed to win. 12-3 and 3 pro points with Twin. #gppitt
Beat Zoo. 11-3 #traitor #gppitt
@KeaneFrady i technically lost on my t3 to a pact.
Narrowly lost to Podless Pod. No top 8 for me. 10-3 #gppitt
Got turn 2ed by Amulet then lost a long game 2 where I got stuck on lands (though might lose that one either way). 10-2 #gppitt
Had some nice topdecks against Grixis. 10-1 #gppitt
4-0 against Jund/Junk now, which feels pretty lucky. 9-1 overall. #gppitt
@SamuelHBlack @Skatterbull @magicprotour it worked if I highlighted, copied, then pasted elsewhere. Would rather just not know the info.
@_Stormtrooper_ thanks!
@SamuelHBlack @magicprotour same. What's the deck that's 35%?
Beat an Affinity opponent that mulled to 4 to end the day at 8-1. #gppitt
Lost to Faeries (!), 7-1 now. #gppitt
@shaheenmtg I hope they ban it, then you lose to Magus of the Moon.

@fffreakmtg if you're counting teams, at least six.
@paulrietzl (my "like" only pertains to the Sealed/Draft portion of your tweet.)
@SamuelHBlack @mtg_law_etc @mtg_lee on the plus side,  I haven't spewed much value by continually dropping for bed after 1-2 rounds.
@lsv @TrickMTG @PVDDR so, "whichever side you think will annoy viewers?"
@TrickMTG @PVDDR (I have no real reason for this; just what I've always done.)
@PVDDR @TrickMTG I'm right handed, and draw with my right hand, but keep my deck to the left.
@lsv @mtg_law_etc the format is played online with untuned decks for 4ish days before the PT.  Doubt it would be of much use there.
@lsv so you're saying CFB was taken off the distribution list since I left the team?
@SwitchGlitchmon yeah, I doubt I'll ever play it again after Atlanta.
@bazardebagda Yep, agreed. I think the longest I've waited between Standard League matches is 3 minutes.
@bazardebagda basically at no point in my week do I have time for a DE. Leagues are perfect (now add them for Sealed).
@bazardebagda so I'm forced to play two mans, I guess?
@bazardebagda was this Modern? I tried to join a League yesterday and it said it was closed. Why is that a thing?
Check out my BFZ Sealed video on @ChannelFireball in preparation for #GPAtlanta this weekend:

@lsv @OwenTweetenwald @WalkThePlanes Gotta be either Green Converge or Gx Allies.
@lsv @bazardebagda skipping one of the few Limited GPs (that you already have a flight for) is so dumb. Skip all the Legacy/Modern you want.

@DClatterbuck @Zakman86 but anyway it is easy enough to see names on site, the breakdown of archetypes you have is more useful to most.
@DClatterbuck @Zakman86 Yeah, it is cut to top 8, and play one round.  Ranking within top 4 is just tiebreakers.
@DClatterbuck @Zakman86 well, isn't top 4 just tied for 1st?  Not like they play it out after. (I don't think you need to add names at all.)
@DClatterbuck do they list who won where you found this?  More concerned about that than decks. :)
@DClatterbuck  sweet, thanks!

@InsayneHayne @JacobWilson95 Didn't @VICE already do this?
@patriotfan09 @NumotTheNummy @lsv @Marshall_LR Dunno what Luis did, but I support the proliferation of the #LiesScumVillainy hashtag.
@SwitchGlitchmon @lsv I got wrecked in the GP too, though no dragons were involved.
@PESmtg @BraunDuinIt Thanks, got it to work.  (Though it did hang up going to Paypal 3x before I got it to work, just FYI.)
@Conley81 Pretty sure @mtg_law_etc did this in draft at the PT.
@PESmtg @BraunDuinIt okay, thanks. Can you please tweet when resolved?
@BraunDuinIt Doesn't work for me.  Asked about it earlier, but no response from @PESmtg yet.
@JeffHoogland @MadtownLems @PESmtg just get an error here. Tried both on computer and phone.
Anyone else having trouble registering for #gppittsburgh?  Registration link won't load for me.  @PESmtg

@NerdDC #old
@NerdDC were you ever good at Halo? I always sucked at these games.
When are Sealed Leagues coming?  About to drop after one round to go to bed; would feel a lot better to just play round 2 tomorrow night!
@aNDy_grey lose for top 8 and get 15th? (What I did in last GP Atlanta.)
@aNDy_grey do any more GPs feed Atlanta?
@BraunDuinIt @shaheenmtg @ThaaatsGameBoys Isn't this going to be a different Limited format than the current one?
Is there a list of who won RPTQs last weekend posted somewhere?  Didn't hear much about them with all the GPs going on.
@paulrietzl Freakonomics and Hardcore History
16 Wild Nacatls in top 8 of #gppoa? Maybe Modern isn't so bad.
@PVDDR @thepchapin wow, wish I had saved some money and flown there!
@SilverCreekGame @lsv Yeah, I'm not big on this stuff and even I have the Mt. Fuji Mountain for my unplayable Legacy Zoo deck.
@lsv I assume the top is all APAC?  Only know the kangaroo one.  But you should use those because that's the best Plains.
Probably won't have time this trip, but my favorite thing about Indy is the cool Vonnegut stuff. #GPIndy #Vonnegut https://t.co/ULuq3WfJ4i
@patriotfan09 @lsv #LiesScumVillainy
@lsv is this what you're teaching people on your podcast?
@strong_sad @SamuelHBlack I still buy it because it means I can fly in Sat morning, but yes it should be a nominal (~$5) fee if anything.
@lsv @Marshall_LR as we've also gone over many times, it was roughly 1/10,000, whereas maybe 200 people were at both GPs.
@lsv @Marshall_LR you opened Mortars and Pack Rat. Twice.
@jkyu06 yep.
@jkyu06 Yeah I didn't even have that guy in g2, but sided out my few instants to make Dispel dead.
@cascadegamesllc @HeleneBergeot please make a green apple one with Wild Nacatl!
@lsv @ChannelFireball @MatthewNass Wow, more like Lies Scum Villainy.
@OwenTweetenwald well, that part is moderately impossible at 13 mana.  But I was more thinking want to cast it t4 to return t5.
@OwenTweetenwald yeah, I like 3. Have no double of either base color.

@thepchapin Cheon?
Shouldn't this Visionary be dead? Didn't he sac something to Husk at start of turn? #GPQC
@klumpital @MagicOnline Nevermind I lied, this fixed it.  Thanks a lot! (Not sure how ORCs didn't suggest this!)
@AndreasPischner @MagicOnline Tried that along with deleting and remaking the binder several times; cards just never show up.
@lsv @GabySpartz congrats on the best possible outcome!
@lsv well, at least you learn from your mistakes.
@MTGTheTruth Referring to charging for even carry on bags; not sure how recent that fee is.
@lsv @bazardebagda @bmkibler Frontier has similar bullshit fees, but I haven't had any real issues.
@dwpoker @BenS8528 @Marshall_LR don't worry, he didn't tell him that Noyan Dar is #5.
@_DavidOchoa @Marshall_LR I don't remember this exact story, just that you had three Dispels in the same stack and it was bullshit.
@_DavidOchoa @Marshall_LR what if you cast the guy turn 6 and have Dispel up?
@OwenTweetenwald so you're saying you had the Bile Blights the whole time in those WW vs Black Devotion matches? I tilted for nothing!
@Marshall_LR yes.
@lsv @mtg_law_etc so you'd be a rules lawyer?
@PVDDR I DID almost tweet this comment a couple days ago.
@lsv @PVDDR sometimes I record a video and it doesn't go up for 2+ weeks.  #scum
@PVDDR obviously ridiculous; not sure what thoughts you're looking for here?  Asking if other readers feel the same way?
@armlx yes trying to unmorph or block with any morph causes MODO to crash. Really fucked up my testing of GW Megamorph.
@FrankyMTG Played the same 75 as @Nacatls4Life.  Pretty sure he wrote an article about the deck, may want to check that out.
@FrankyMTG I think it was good as far as GW lists go, but hindsight being 20/20 I'd probably have played Sam's deck.

@lsv @Marshall_LR would you have won Berlin if you didn't have five games to figure out how many Jittes to bring in?
@Smdster @Marshall_LR @mtgaaron @Kengy5 @HeleneBergeot the SBing back and forth in Tamada vs. Finkel would've been awesome with more games.
@thepchapin the list in @PVDDR's article felt pretty close.
@Jonnymagic00 @thepchapin @paulrietzl @OwenTweetenwald @efropoker look up @Quick_MTGStat (I don't think it has been updated after t8.)
@kaibudde incredibly expensive.
@bazardebagda I do like having a bigger gap between Gold and Plat so they feel distinct, instead of Gold being a consolation prize.
RT @bmkibler: Abzan beats Jeskai in the finals of the pro tour. #PTKTK...wait I mean #PTBFZ
@BraunDuinIt Pro Tour account tweeted the link.
GP point changes are great. Felt very odd that there was no 2 point finish for awhile there.
