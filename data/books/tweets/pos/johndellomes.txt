@maltairs i think the guy on the left needs a bit more urgency in his body language: a greater tilt to his run or maybe an outstretched arm
@LeSeanThomas true true.
@LeSeanThomas so if they make it by some miracle, it might be interesting
@LeSeanThomas i agree, theyre still unsteady and need a couple more years. that said, the Raps DID beat the CAVS 2-1 in regulation this year
@LeSeanThomas we're young, but the Raptors have multiple all-stars too, esp the last couple of years!

@saraxxxii that means x1, x2, x3 and wolverine origins dont matter in new movie continuity, only first class and days do
@saraxxxii the thing to rmbr is this: days of future past resets/erases all the x-men and related movies that came before first class

@Sean_G_Murphy @sequenceart ooooo I don't usually do the Kickstarter thing but I might just do it for this...
Final at work after the commute of hell
@maltairs haha I know how that feels... I used to be a receiver at chapters so I got first dibs on EVERYTHING
Snow traffic = I am still not at work despite leaving home early...
@maltairs at least it's better than Toronto üò≠ https://t.co/9wmj54gwi8
Everyone has forgotten how to drive in the snow again...
I'm pretty sure my parents brought back the flu from my aunt's place because I've been feeling like crap all weekend
@CBR but it's NOT an Easter egg, it's a still from an unfinished deleted scene that vfx completed as a gift... #theresadifference
i just realized #Serenity is back on @netflix so now there goes my desire to sleep...
@vsquaredk everytime i see that youre in trouble i wanna help but then you good and im all "yay" but also "why am i always late to help" lol
@LeSeanThomas had a potential client ask me once: "are you sure you didnt typo that extra zero?" -_-
@vsquaredk whaaaaaaaa
@tessarlo always. That threshold = extra life
@nicodelort why does that happen more often than not lol
A day and a half of nothing but building product mock-ups at work... I can finally do some designing again haha
This is why I delete/don't show my warm-up doodles lol... #art #digitalillustration #digitalart‚Ä¶ https://t.co/plI6Ec3xTx
Looks like that tiny chance of the office moving to downtown Toronto jumped to big chance...
@nicodelort oh damn I hadnt seen the final. I think I know what you mean tho. Theres a greater sense of drama with the blks around the face.
@nicodelort you mean this ISN'T done? If you didn't say so, I'd have thought so... That white space just makes everything pop

@LeSeanThomas yeah it was really odd. So Lexcorp came up with both their codenames AND logos??
@BrandSanderson for a second there I thought that number was 95% lol
@saraxxxii nothing really, just had too much thinking time...
@Marvel @KimJungGiUS EPIC
@FrancisManapul they're good... but there are better...
@Sean_G_Murphy that brushwork blows me away every time
@MahmudAsrar wow can't stop staring at it haha
yeah... i think i need more comics and video games to hide under...
then there are my aunts who keep hinting that i should become a nurse since design is easy and can be done in my spare time
even when i finally got my current job, my dad (again) handed me an application for an aeronautics mechanic course that he would pay for...
they can't seem to get out of the thinking that there is no such thing as a creative career
eg2. despite their good intentions, some of my relatives equate my career in design to a hobby...
we ended up hiring one but added another to our freelance pile. because again, skill set.
really dad? really?... i flat out told him that doesnt matter. we looked at every applicant's skill set first and last to choose who to hire
eg1. told my dad how we hired someone new, and his first question was "anong lahi?" (what's their ethnicity?)
it's been bouncing around my head, especially since this weekend, that there are times when i am reminded of how conservative my family is
especially while i ponder if i should move downtown considering the odds of the office going there seem to be increasing...
it's a drawing and watching cartoons kind of night
@maltairs there are Quebec swears? I guess I should pay more attention next time I'm in Montreal...
@instagram 's timeline change is kinda dumb... Actually no, make that really stupid #keepinstagramchronological
@saraxxxii Easter Monday isn't an official day off like in aus. #imakecalendars
@ollymoss KEEP IT. KEEP IT FOREVER
Goes to work, sees half the offices in the building closed... Why can't I have Easter Monday off too?? #grumpy
theres a tiny chance that the office might be moving to dt toronto and im crying from looking at how expensive a nice place would be...
@saraxxxii lol never said do that... just mean that you have to make sure you know what you're talking abt if you're going to refer to it...
@saraxxxii because using it as reference = having watched the whole thing that resulted in a complete and thorough understanding...
@saraxxxii -_- then dont use it as reference!
@saraxxxii i hated social network
@saraxxxii one does not cancel out the other
and just for comparison, rmbr how @Marvel did it? they took their time and for the most part used after credit scenes to connect everything
it's lain the groundwork for the future of the dc cinematic universe... and i can only hope that they somehow get their shit together
but i digress. although imperfect and odd in how it's trying to do the work of at least 2 movies on it's own, #bvs has done its job
it couldve been way better than it was, instead of them shoving every cameo/easter egg/seed for future movies down our throats
and what the hell is up lex luthor coming up with the league's symbols/icons/codenames
and eisenberg? really? as my sister says: that wasn't lex luthor. that was a weird riddler/joker thing
rushing to build it without laying a foundation down...
this movie really shows how @DC is seriously playing catch up to @Marvel in building a cinematic universe
as in LOTS better...
but honestly, they could've done better
it's also nice to see that they're trying to give a different flavour of superhero than @Marvel does
it was nice to finally see the dc trinity on the big screen together
@saraxxxii yeah no.
did i like it? overall, yes
so let's get my thoughts abt #bvs out: it was a mediorce movie
hell, i even gave the train wreck that is fant4stic a shot...
i mean, i liked MoS and i try to go into these movies objectively and give them their fair shot at wowing me...
i guess it's because there's a weird conflict in my own head regarding the whole thing...
ive been fairly quiet abt #bvs , which is odd considering how crazy i get for anything involving superheroes
@saraxxxii except whenever eisenberg was on i hope... terrible...
@saraxxxii so late to the party lol....
@saraxxxii another reason to come visit: reserved seating for movies :P
@maltairs yes. Yes it is.
@vsquaredk i have to zone out before i become comfortable of ppl watching me draw... it's why you have to poke me during fanexpo lol
@karengillan I used to work in a bookstore with someone who would sniff the new books that came in... Said nothing beat the new book smell
need color practice... black and white i can handle... color, not so much #fanart #art https://t.co/B0LXr8IwSe
@vsquaredk can I draw said book? Colouring is my kryptonite so I look forward to some else doing it lol
@kristaferanka I'm excited for it too!
@saraxxxii foggy is coming to Fanexpo! If I manage to go to his panel, I'm gonna try to make the crowd quack lol
@saraxxxii it seems like that but it doesn't
Because honestly, choosing between 2 heroes you grew up with is just wrong
That said, as someone who enjoyed MoS for the most part, I'm going to watch #BatmanvSuperman wearing a Superman shirt and a Batman belt
I don't follow Rotten Tomatoes or reviewers. I'm generally excited for every comic book movie that comes... Except for fant4stic... So bad..
@LeSeanThomas WHAT. AMAZING. NEWS. Time to put the original on a loop until the new one comes out.
Gasp! Time travel shenanigans means it's you Canadian birthday today @kookkki :)
Daily dilemma at this time of day: to draw or play video games when I get home lol
@RosemaryTravale I wanna have a Travale original! I totally dropped the ball on getting art trades when we were at Sheridan... :(
Need more #Daredevil now please. Awesome season, looking forward to the next one! @Marvel @netflix
FISK! #Daredevil
#Daredevil ep8 THE HAND IS HERE
Elektra is all sorts of crazy awesome #Daredevil
#Daredevil ep3 is all I can think abt right now... That debate and that fight... #DaredevilSeason2
Do I have to go to work now? I wanna keep watching #Daredevil
wow that hallway/stairwell #daredevil
Yes. Now. :) #daredevil #netflix #marvel https://t.co/FV7p9eFie5
Got home before the rain and now gearing up for an early bedtime to watch #DaredevilSeason2 at 3am :D
@JohnDellomes ...maaaaaaan, now i feel old
@JohnDellomes ...which last happened 10 YEARS AGO back at sheridan college...
@JohnDellomes ..im sitting cross-legged on my chair wearing sweats, a hoodie, and big headphones with my hair up...
i feel like i'm back in college...
im laying down flats and all i can think of is why is my approach to color so much better in illustrator than in photoshop? #artistproblems
@gamerintheshell lol i know.
@gamerintheshell dont forget also ranked happier than OZ in the happiness report (although that might change should trump get elected)

just found out that a few acquaintances thought that the prequels were better and im just "WHAT?!" #StarWarsTheForceAwakens
@saraxxxii or something similar. no jello/noodles. should ease her stomach into retaining liquid food first if she's been throwing up
@saraxxxii warm chicken broth (no noodles)
@LeSeanThomas i know what you mean. can't stop thinking about it either.
@McKelvie solution: no caffeine or powernap neccessary, #starwars will be enough to wake you up lol
