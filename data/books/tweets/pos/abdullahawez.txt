Last thing to say: that parliament session delayed because of intra-family differences is based on sources - rest is my own analysis.
Even though Barzani steps down to save his family rule, but end of his rule is the beginning of the end of Barzani family rule.
Some sort of power-sharing between the two may cease the problems for now, but will hunt the family rule in the longer future.
To solve the problem, for now, Barzani may have to give some of his powers to Masrur's security council instead of giving all to Nechervan.
While he quits to save the family, the problems within Nechervan vs Masrur may harm the family more than outside reasons.
Now with Barzani's dicision to quick the problem have become bolder, Barzani knows without settling while alive, may lead to confrontation.
Even Rudaw and K24 coverages since the kirkuk events until now and even on PKK and Turkey are quite different.
Nechervan and Masrur also each have their own media (Rudaw is Nechervan and K24 is Masrur) and have their own university (UKh and AUK).
Nechervan and Masrur have their own loyal brigades within Zeravani and Peshmarga and each built their own loyal personal teams.
Even when Nechervan introduced biometric system - to reform the economy - Masrur refused to have his employee register there.
The recent clashes with Iraqi army are all spearheaded by KR security council led by Masrur - he believes Kurds should impose independence.
Masrur is in favor of war rather than surrender - he isn't only against annulling referendum, he was even against freezing it.
Now Masrur wasn't to put obstacles on the succession process - and he is in favor of an agreesive approach to Baghdad.
As the referendum backfired, it automatically gave Nechervan upper hand vs Masrur. Now Barzani's decided to back Nechervan as his successor.
Nechervan Barzani was not in support of the referendum - differences about referendum is real - Nechervan's main fear was angering Turkey.
Masrur was the likely successor of his father before the referendum - and referendum was his project to dominate power.

Interview with PM Abadi: Iraqi Leader Aims to Keep U.S.-Iran Rivalry From Destabilizing Country https://t.co/EeP2ndCUKQ
Nechervan is still his nephew &amp; part of the family - so by deciding to step down, Barzani is actually trying to save the rule of his family.
Barzani preferred oldest son Masrur to replace him but as the referendum backfired, the only acceptable option for now is Nechervan.
Barzani is kinda isolated and nobody is ready to visit or receive him so he has to make the difficult decision which is stepping down.
There still direct threats on oil &amp; Erbil, only country capable to save Barzani family is Turkey, which wants Barzani gone (want Nechervan!)
The recent changes, inc referendum freeze, which was made by government (Nechervan) are part of moves to prevent collapse of Barzani rule.
If Barzani loses the oil resources &amp; control over border crossing, that'll put Barzani rule in jeopardy - also Khurmala is 25km from Erbil.
Iraqi forces are also pushing to advance toward Khurmala oilfield, near Makhmour - which is KDP (Barzani family’s) largest source of cash.
Fish Khabur, route of KRG pipeline &amp; border w Rojava, are as big as Erbil for Barzani this is why his son Mansour &amp; best KDP forces there.
In last few days, Barzani been under tremendous pressure as Iraq forces been pushing to reach KRG pipeline &amp;there's direct threats on Erbil.
After the referendum, Talabani family Uturn &amp; major recent setbacks have pushed Barzani to a corner with no regional, international support.
On end of Barzani's presidency: I think the primary reason for Barzani's decision to step down is to save his family's rule. Here is how:

Of course these are just rumors, doesn't necessarily mean they're real -but thought worth mentioning them as alot of people talk about them.
Other rumors (even NRT made a report about it) is that Barzani is angry at his son Masrur, believes his insistence on referendum led to this
There're also talks that Barzani has told his nephew, KRG PM Nechervan Barzani, you have all my powers and support to improve the situation.

KDP, holds the west Kirkuk frontline &amp; controls Bai Hassan and Avana oilfields have decided to fight any forces gets close from their front.
Sheikh Ja'afar, commander of PUK Peshmerga who is in Kirkuk now, also refuses the agreements.
What complicates matter is that Kosrat Rasul, deputy leader of PUK has a Peshmerga brigade loyal to him in K1 base &amp; refuse the agreement.
Talabani family which has support of majority of PUK politburo seems to have reached agreement w Baghdad: co-run airport, K1 base &amp;oilfields
Tomorrow's meeting is important because Iraqi forces have extended deadline for 24 hours to give PUK more time to reach agreement with KDP.

RT @Mikeknightsiraq: Here's a quick piece on the Kirkuk stand-off https://t.co/aC3NX2jfB5
https://t.co/FN4hN77eXn
Iran, through Qasim Solemani, seems to be actively working on splitting PUK-controlled Sulimani &amp; Kirkuk from KDP-controled Erbil &amp; Duhok.
If PUK gives up fields, it may face a split or Iran may try to expel pro-Barzani leaders, affectively making PUK a Talabani family business.
On southern oilfields: PUK won't just hand them, but there are news of an Iran brokered deal between Baghdad and PUK away from Barzani.
But there's no way KDP will give up the western oilfields while Iraqi forces insist to take them, which means a confrontation there's likely
The southern Kirkuk oilfields are controlled by forces loyal to Talabani family and there is a possibility they handover the fields to Iraq.
Meanwhile the southern Kirkuk oil fields are controlled by PUK, the western oilfields controlled by KDP.
Dr Karim and Kosrat Rasul (who are close from Barzani) are an important duo in Kirkuk because Dr Karim has popularity &amp; Kosrat has force.
The Talabani family and their majority within the PUK politburo are determined to remove Dr Karim, while Kosrat Rasul backs him.
The (Iran-backed) Iraqi forces primarily want to things: remove Kirkuk governor Dr Najmaldim Karim and takeover the oil fields.
The Iraqi forces near Kirkuk appear to be largely Federal police (close from Badr which is pro-Iran) and PMF militias close from Iran.
The recent Kirkuk crisis is multiple battles at the sametime:
Iraq vs Kurdistan
KDP vs PUK
PUK vs PUK
Abadi vs Maliki

Despite speaking same language &amp; same religion, division between Sulimani vs Erbil-Duhok is beyond party division, also cultural&amp; historial.
KRG to this moment has two peshmarga forces, one loyal to KDP &amp; other to PUK; and Sulimania always been closer to iran &amp; Erbil to Turkey.
If happened, it'll effectively mean the return of post 1996 civil war division of KRG into two administrations. https://t.co/TEvs0rvCJl
Including sending salaries and budget to PUK-controlled Sulimania &amp; lift travel ban on Sulimania airport among other things.
I've even read in some local Kurdish media (but couldn't confirm) that PUK (Talabani family) may unilaterally reach an agreement w Baghdad.
They may reach an agreement with Baghdad without handing over these areas, if they appoint a new governor in kirkuk, that is loyal enough.
PUK (Talabani family) may need accept handover these areas but they have publicly said they want to change Dr Najmaldin Karim.
Baghdad (&amp;Tehran) been working on dividing Kurds Pre &amp; post referendum, they might be closer than ever from getting Talabanis in their side.

And there are some talk that among the PUK leadership there's a belief that Lahur Talabani, may have leaked it to PKK.
@Kvote2191 Ettela'at is Iran's intelligence agency, similar to Turkey's MIT.
@Kvote2191 Turkey thinks so too.
TR believes either PUK or Ettela'at has told PKK about the plan or PKK has developed a spy network that has penetrated even PUK leadership.
coz Sulimani isn't safe due to strong presence of Iran's Ettela'at . On way back to Erbil, PKK manages to abduct them &amp; move them to Qandil.
But after the Op planned the info reaches PKK, so Cemil Bayik's planned visit to Sulimani cancels, MIT asks the agents to return to Erbil+
Then MIT sends a team to Erbil to prepare them to either kidnap Bayik or kill him if they failed to kidnap him.
Because among PKK leader only Cemil Bayik has back pain as he had been injured during a battle with Turkish military in 90s.
To visit Qandil to see a PKK leader that's back pain and later the information had been leaked to MIT &amp; they knew that person is Cemil Bayik
Apparently this's how the story'd developed: a couple PKK members have visited a hospital in Sulimani to ask if it is possible for a doctor+
Reports that TR believe a PUK leader told PKK about the op as PUK failed to explain how PKK managed to take the agents all the way to Qandil
The failed operation have been extremely secret with only very few people knew about it, only a number of people in KRG were aware of it.
The abduction of MIT agents have taken place a month ago and according to new reports they were four, three Turks and a Kurd from Turkey.
Apparently the abduction of the MIT agents near Sulimani and Turkish decision to expel PUK representative in Ankara is more complicated.
@PinarTremblay I have no idea, no one really knows as for now.
NRT now reports 2 MIT agents who had earlier arrived in Sulimani via Sulimania international airport were abducted by PKK outside the city.
The reports from PUK, PKK media claim Cemil Bayik was about to go to a hospital in Sulimani because of pain in his back &amp; MIT knew about it.

@GreenerTalk Both are as needed. If he has time for international media, he can make some for local media too.
@MeraJBakr When he can talk to both, he can talk to the Kurdish people and directly through Kurdish local media.
He cares more about int. audience while kurds are the ones who vote; international media is no doubt important, but so is local media.
So Barzani has started doing interviews with international media but has done none with local Kurdish media!

Of course beside giving hope to hopeless Iranians every four years.

Nawsherwan Mustafa been a Peshmarga since 1967, he studied political science in Baghdad; he was also an intellectual, historian &amp; writer.
I have met Nawsherwan many times, he was a visionary leader who wanted to institutionalise Iraqi kurdistan &amp; write a liberal constitution.
Mustafa, whose party had speaker of Kurdish parliament, was the engineer of changing a law to block Barzani from continuing as president.
RIP.
Since KRG's establishment in 1991, Gorran has been the only opposition party that challenged both KDP and PUK, changing KRG's political map.
Mustafa, who split from PUK in 2006 and founded Gorran in 2009 is the third most influential Iraqi Kurdish leader after Barzani &amp; Talabani.
Nawsherwan Mustafa, leader of Gorran movement and the only Iraqi Kurdish leader who could challenge Barzani passed away in the age of 73.
