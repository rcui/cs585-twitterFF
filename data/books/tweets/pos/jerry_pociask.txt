Hello Twitter! #myfirstTweet
@SouthernOwl1 Based on Celtic and Native American beliefs and lore!
@karenvwrites I have recently read this beautiful book written by Jerry Pociask. 'Grandma, Me and Tree'
@karenvwrites "Call Me Grandpa" soon to be released as an ebook! "Grandma Me and Tree" is catching on in other countries!
@karenvwrites Both stories contain life lessons and beliefs steeped in the love of nature and Native American spirituality
